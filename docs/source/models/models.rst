lucid.models
============

The `lucid.models` package provides a collection of predefined neural network 
architectures that are ready to use for various tasks, such as image classification 
and feature extraction. These models are designed to demonstrate key deep learning 
concepts while leveraging the modular and educational nature of the `lucid` framework.

Computer Vision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Computer Vision (CV) is a field of artificial intelligence that enables machines to interpret 
and understand visual information from the world, such as images and videos. It involves 
teaching computers to process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in a way similar to 
human vision.

Generative Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generative Models are a class of models that learn to generate visual data, such as images. 
Unlike discriminative models that focus on classification or prediction, generative models aim to 
capture the underlying distribution of image data in order to produce new samples. This section 
focuses specifically on vision-based generative tasks such as image synthesis, reconstruction, 
and visual representation learning.

Natural Language Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to 
understand, interpret, and generate human language. It combines linguistics and machine learning 
to process text or speech, allowing models to perform tasks like translation, summarization, 
and sentiment analysis.
