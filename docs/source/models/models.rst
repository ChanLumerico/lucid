    * - ConvNets
      - Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are deep learning models designed 
        for processing grid-like data (e.g., images) using convolutional layers to 
        extract spatial features efficiently.

    * - Transformers
      - Transformers are deep learning models that use self-attention mechanisms to 
        process sequential data in parallel, enabling efficient learning of long-range 
        dependencies.
