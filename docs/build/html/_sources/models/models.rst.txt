.. rubric:: LeNet

LeNet is a pioneering CNN by Yann LeCun for digit recognition, 
combining convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. 
It introduced concepts like weight sharing and local receptive fields, 
shaping modern CNNs.

.. rubric:: ZFNet

ZFNet (Zeiler and Fergus Net) is a convolutional neural network that improved upon 
AlexNet by using smaller convolutional filters and visualizing learned features to 
better understand network behavior. It achieved state-of-the-art results in object 
recognition and provided insights into deep learning interpretability.
