"""Hold this interpreter to the packages CI's gate installs.

``scripts/ci_local.sh`` puts this directory on ``PYTHONPATH``, so every
Python process the gate starts — pytest, the audit's children, the zoo
sweep's — imports it first.  A developer's venv carries far more than the
hosted runner: the reference framework, the model-zoo oracles, scipy.  A
test that finds one of them runs, or takes another path, where on CI it
skips, so a local pass would say little about the run that counts.

Everything installed that CI would not install is made absent the way the
import system itself spells it: ``sys.modules[name] = None``.  ``import``
then raises ``ModuleNotFoundError`` and ``importlib.util.find_spec``
returns ``None`` — both exactly as on a runner that never had it.

What CI installs is read, not listed: ``pyproject.toml``'s dependencies and
``test`` extra, the tools the phase-gate job installs beside them
(``_CI_TOOLS``), and everything those require, per the installed metadata.
