# CI's push gate on this machine, before the push.
#
# The push gate is three parts of scripts/ci_full.sh — core, coreml and
# checks — each a job on a hosted runner.  A push that fails there costs the
# queue, the runner's minutes and the round trip before anyone knows, and
# the push that fixes it starts the clock again.  This runs the same parts
# here, side by side, in interpreters held to what CI installs
# (scripts/ci_mirror), and says which part failed before anything leaves.
#
#   ./scripts/ci_local.sh                     # core, coreml and checks at once
#   ./scripts/ci_local.sh checks zoo:1/2      # any parts ci_full.sh knows
#   LUCID_LOCAL_NO_BUILD=1 ./scripts/ci_local.sh    # the engine is current
#
# Different from CI on purpose: the engine is built with uv, as every local
# build is, and the publish gate is skipped — a uv venv has no pip to build
# the wheel with, and CI still runs it.  One log per part, in
# $LUCID_LOCAL_LOGS (default: a fresh temporary directory).
