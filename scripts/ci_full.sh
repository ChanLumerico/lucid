#
#   core      the fast tier's main process
#   coreml    the Core ML tests and the family export smoke
#   checks    the parity / integration / perf tiers, every validator, the
#             audit and doctest stages, the zoo's contract and checkpoints,
#             the docs summaries, format, and the publish gate
#   zoo[:K/N] zoo compiled training — shard K of N, or all of it     (slow)
#   native    C++ unit tests, then the UBSan build                    (slow)

# The parts split what one job did in sequence: the push gate was 21
# minutes, 14 of them the fast tier, and a full run 137, of which the
# checkpoint fit took 67 and the zoo sweep 29 — each waiting on the others
# for no reason but order.  Together the parts run exactly what the single
# job did.

# LUCID_CI_SLOW_STAGES=0 drops the slow parts (pushes set it).  Two more
# switches serve scripts/ci_local.sh: LUCID_CI_SKIP_BUILD=1 (the caller
# installed the engine already) and LUCID_CI_SKIP_PUBLISH=1 (no pip to
