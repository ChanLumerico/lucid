"""tools/check_weight_fit.py — assert every published checkpoint still fits
the factory that offers it.

A factory and the checkpoint it ships drift apart silently.  Nothing about
``num_encoder_layers=6`` looks wrong next to a config whose default is 0,
and the model builds, trains and exports either way — the only thing that
breaks is ``pretrained=True``, which no test exercised.  Three families
were shipping unloadable weights when this was written:

  * ``sk_resnet_18/34_cls`` — a paper floor (L=32) the checkpoints were
    trained without, so the two narrow stages wanted 32-wide attention
    against a 16-wide checkpoint.
  * ``maskformer_resnet50/101`` — a 6-layer transformer encoder the
    checkpoints have no weights for, contradicting the config's own
    comment.
  * ``resnest_200/269_cls`` — a dropout that moves the classifier to
    ``classifier.1``, against a checkpoint converted from a flat head.

**No weight data is downloaded.**  A safetensors file opens with a
length-prefixed JSON header naming every tensor and its shape, so two
HTTP range requests (a few KB) answer the question for a checkpoint of
any size.

**The factory is called, not imitated.**  An earlier version of this
check rebuilt the model itself and reported six false positives, because
factories do things a reimplementation does not: load into a submodule
(``model.dit``, ``model.diamond``), derive config from the entry
(per-game action counts), or switch config on whether overrides were
passed.  Here ``load_weight_entry`` is intercepted instead — the factory
runs its real path and hands over the very module the load targets, then
the download is skipped.

**Nothing is allocated either.**  Only names and shapes are compared, so
the factory runs under :func:`lucid.nn._shadow.shadow_alloc`, where every
tensor is shape metadata.  Building the real weights was nearly all of
this check's time — 67 minutes of a nightly run, BERT-large alone 16 s,
against milliseconds in shadow.  A factory shadow mode cannot follow is
built for real instead, and the run says which.  The headers are then
read over parallel connections.

What a pass does *not* mean
---------------------------
Structure, not identity.  This reads the header and compares names and
shapes; it never hashes the file.  A checkpoint replaced by a different
revision of the same architecture passes here and is caught only by
``_verify_sha256`` at download time, which needs all the bytes.

There is no cheap stand-in for that: the Hub's ``ETag`` is not the
content digest — checked against four entries that download and verify
cleanly, and it differed from the declared SHA-256 for every one.

And a fit says the weights *load*, not that they are any good.  No
accuracy is verified anywhere in this repository; see
``obsidian/api/api-python-models.md`` on registration not being
validation.

Run::

    python -m tools.check_weight_fit                   # every checkpoint
    python -m tools.check_weight_fit --family sknet    # one family
    python -m tools.check_weight_fit --model resnet_18_cls
    python -m tools.check_weight_fit --list            # print, do not check

Exit codes
----------
0 — every checkpoint fits, or none was reachable to test.
1 — at least one checkpoint does not fit its factory.
2 — the network could not be reached for some checkpoint (reported
    separately from a mismatch, because "unknown" is not "broken").
