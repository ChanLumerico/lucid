"""tools/check_dead_config_fields.py — a Config field the model never reads.

A model family's ``_config.py`` is a frozen dataclass, and nothing
checks that the fields it declares reach the forward pass. They
routinely do not: the config is usually written before the model, and a
field that never gets wired changes no shape, raises nothing and is
invisible to every other gate.

V-JEPA 2 shipped with four of them. ``drop_path_rate`` was the clearest:

    rates = [drop_path_rate * i / max(depth - 1, 1) for i in range(depth)]
    blocks = [_Block(...) for _ in rates]     # rates counted, never used

The per-depth rates were computed and thrown away, ``_Block`` had no
DropPath at all, and the validator, the family contract test, ``mypy
--strict``, ruff and the summary builder all passed. A user setting
``drop_path_rate=0.3`` got a model identical to ``0.0``.

How a field is credited
-----------------------
This is a *name* check, not a dataflow one, and it credits a field
three ways. The first version had only the first of them and
over-reported by more than half — ten of the seventeen fields it
flagged were reached by one of the other two:

``own``
    The name appears somewhere in the family's own sources outside the
    config that declares it. The ordinary case.

``derived``
    The name appears in ``_config.py`` itself, inside a method other
    than ``__post_init__`` or a ``_validate*`` helper — a derived
    property the model reads. ``flow_matching.exact_trace_max_dim``
    only ever reaches the model through ``resolved_trace_method``.
    Validators are excluded deliberately: a field that is only
    range-checked still does nothing.

``config-read``
    Some other file in the zoo reads it *off a config* —
    ``config.x`` / ``cfg.x`` / ``self._cfg.x`` / ``getattr(cfg, "x")``.
    Mask R-CNN's ``rpn_*`` thresholds are consumed by Faster R-CNN's
    shared proposal layer, and the text families' ``eos_token_id`` by
    ``GenerationMixin``; neither name occurs in the owning family at
    all. The receiver is required — matching a bare ``.x`` credited
    ``ddpm.clip_denoised`` to the *scheduler's* own attribute of that
    name, which is a different variable that happens to agree.

Two things it still cannot see, both worth knowing:

* A name mentioned but overridden at the call site, as
  ``uniform_power`` was by ``_sincos_3d(dim, grid, False)``.
* Whose config a ``config-read`` belongs to. A field name shared
  across a domain's configs is credited domain-wide, so
  ``LanguageModelConfig``'s token ids count as read for every text
  family once one of them reads them.

Read the call sites when adding a family; this catches the half a
reader would otherwise have to hold in their head. ``--list`` prints
the rule that credited each field so the verdict can be audited rather
than trusted.

Everything left over is in ``_ALLOWED`` with a reason. There is no
untriaged baseline: a field that is neither read nor answered for
fails the gate.

Run::

    python tools/check_dead_config_fields.py
    python tools/check_dead_config_fields.py --list   # every field, with its verdict

Exit codes
----------
0 — every declared field is read by one of the three rules, or allowed.
1 — at least one is neither.
