"""DIAMOND weight converter — the released agents → Lucid.

Twenty-six checkpoints, one per Atari 100k game, each a flat state dict
holding all three networks.  The mapping is almost a rename, because the
Lucid model was rebuilt against these files: the module tree matches
stage for stage and block for block.

Three renames and one drop are all that is left.

``inner_model`` disappears — the released denoiser wraps its U-Net in an
extra module that only exists to hold the EDM preconditioners, and those
live on :class:`~lucid.models.generative.diamond.DIAMONDModel` here.
``act_emb`` becomes ``action_embed`` and ``lstm`` becomes ``cell``,
matching Lucid's names for an embedding and an LSTM cell.  The released
``act_emb`` is a ``Sequential`` whose only parameter-bearing member is
the embedding, so its ``.0.`` disappears with it.

Each game has its own action count, which is why the tag is the game
name: ``Breakout`` has 4 actions and ``Alien`` 18, and a checkpoint will
not load into a model built for the wrong one.
