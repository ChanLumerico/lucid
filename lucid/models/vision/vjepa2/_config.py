    V-JEPA 2 learns a video representation by predicting the target encoder's
    latent features at hidden tubelet positions.  A 3-D patch embedding turns
    a clip into a sequence of :math:`2\times16\times16` tubelets.  The context
    encoder sees only the unmasked indices, while the predictor inserts learned
    mask tokens and reconstructs the target encoder's representation at the
    held-out indices.  The target encoder is an exponential moving average of
    the context encoder and is not differentiated through.

    The released backbone uses a pre-normalised transformer with three-axis
    rotary position encoding.  Each attention head gives one third of its
    width to time, row and column — rounded down to an even number, so a
    head of 64 channels rotates 20 per axis and leaves the last four
    untouched.  Because position enters through that rotation rather than a
    learned table, a clip of a different length or resolution needs no
    interpolation and no new parameters: the 384-pixel variant is the
    256-pixel network read over a wider grid.

    Two details of the released rotation are reproduced rather than
    corrected.  The frequency half is repeated as a block before adjacent
    feature pairs are rotated, which pairs each rotation with a frequency
    that a straightforward implementation would not choose; the upstream
    source marks it as a bug and keeps it, because the published weights
    were trained through it.  Fixing it yields a different model, not a
    better-implemented one.

    The predictor is narrower than the video encoder — 384 channels and 12
    heads in every released checkpoint, whatever the encoder's width — and
    owns ten mask-token slots, one per block the mask generator samples.  It
    sees the context tokens and the mask tokens together, sorted into token
    order so that a position's identity reaches attention through the same
    rotary coordinates the encoder used, then answers only at the held-out
    positions.  Targets come from the momentum encoder and are
    layer-normalised, so the objective compares directions in
    representation space rather than magnitudes.

    r"""Frozen architecture configuration for V-JEPA 2.

    The defaults are the released ViT-L/16 checkpoint geometry.  The public
    factories select the other paper variants by overriding ``dim``, ``depth``
    and ``num_heads``; callers may still use a small explicit override for
    tests or experiments.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_size : int, default=256
        Height and width of each video frame.
    patch_size : int, default=16
        Spatial side of one patch.
    tubelet_size : int, default=2
        Number of adjacent frames in one token.
    num_frames : int, default=64
        Clip length used by the released pretraining configuration.
    dim, depth, num_heads : int, default=1024, 24, 16
        Width, block count and head count of the video encoder.
    predictor_dim : int, default=384
        Width of the latent predictor.
    predictor_depth : int, default=12
        Number of predictor blocks.
    predictor_heads : int, default=12
        Predictor attention heads.
    predictor_mlp_ratio : float, default=4.0
        Predictor feed-forward expansion.  The ViT-g encoder ratio is wider
        than its predictor ratio in the released checkpoint.
    predictor_num_mask_tokens : int, default=10
        Learned mask-token slots used by the official mask generator.
    use_rope : bool, default=True
        Use the released three-axis rotary attention geometry.
    num_pooler_layers : int, default=3
        Self-attention blocks the attentive probe runs before its query
        attends.  Every released classifier checkpoint carries three.
    ema : tuple of float, default=(0.99925, 0.99925)
        Target-encoder momentum at the start and end of the schedule.
        The released pretraining configuration holds it constant, which
        is where V-JEPA 2 departs from V-JEPA 1's ramp.
    ema_schedule_scale : float, default=1.25
        Stretches the momentum horizon past the run's own length, as the
        released ``ipe_scale`` does.
