"""The transformer the JEPA families share.

I-JEPA reads patches of an image and V-JEPA reads tubelets of a clip, but
between the tokeniser and the loss they are the same network: a pre-norm
block with a fused QKV projection, and the sine/cosine arithmetic their
position tables are built from.  What differs — how pixels become tokens,
how many axes a position has, what a mask covers — stays in the family
that means it.

The names follow the released implementations of both papers
(``blocks.N.attn.qkv``, ``mlp.fc1``), so a published checkpoint maps onto
either model by prefix alone.
