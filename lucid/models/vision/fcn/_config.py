    The Fully Convolutional Network is the first deep model trained
    end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, for **semantic segmentation**.  Its
    core idea is to **convert a classification CNN into a dense
    predictor** by reinterpreting its fully-connected layers as
    :math:`1 \times 1` convolutions and learning to up-sample the
    coarse spatial output back to input resolution.

    A classifier such as VGG-16 ends with FC layers that collapse the
    feature map to a single :math:`1 \times 1 \times K` vector.  By
    rewriting each FC as a convolution with kernel equal to the input
    feature size, the network becomes input-agnostic and produces a
    *heatmap* :math:`\mathbb{R}^{K \times H/s \times W/s}` at the
    backbone's coarse stride :math:`s` (32 for VGG-16, 32 for most
    ResNets).

    To recover full resolution the paper introduces **skip
    architectures** — FCN-32s / FCN-16s / FCN-8s — that combine the
    coarse final layer prediction with the higher-resolution
    intermediate pool-4 and pool-3 predictions through learned
    deconvolutions:

    .. math::

        \hat{y} = \mathrm{upsample}_{2}\!\bigl(
            \mathrm{upsample}_{2}(p_5) + p_4
        \bigr) + p_3, \quad
        \text{(FCN-8s sketch)},

    where :math:`p_\ell` is the per-class score map from level
    :math:`\ell`.  This multi-resolution fusion gives the model
    *coarse* semantic information and *fine* spatial detail without
    needing extra encoder–decoder parameters.

    Training uses a per-pixel softmax cross-entropy loss summed over
    all output positions; the entire model is jointly fine-tuned
    from ImageNet-pretrained classification weights.  FCN
    demonstrated for the first time that segmentation could be a
    "natural" output mode of a CNN, paving the way for U-Net,
    DeepLab, and every subsequent dense-prediction architecture.

    FCN adapts a classification CNN backbone (ResNet) into a dense

    Architecture overview:
      ResNet backbone with dilated convolutions (layer3 dilation=2,
      layer4 dilation=4) → FCN head (3×3 conv + BN + ReLU + 1×1 conv)
      → bilinear upsample to input resolution.

      An auxiliary head on layer3 output provides additional supervision
      during training.
