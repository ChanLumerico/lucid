    ZFNet is the ILSVRC-2013 winner and is best understood as an
    AlexNet that was *tuned by looking at what the network had
    learned*.  Zeiler and Fergus introduced the *deconvolutional
    network* visualisation technique — projecting individual feature-
    map activations back to the input pixel space — and used the
    resulting diagnostic images to reshape the early layers of the
    network.

    Two specific changes distinguish ZFNet from AlexNet.  The first
    convolution was reduced from an :math:`11\times11` stride-4 kernel
    to a :math:`7\times7` stride-2 kernel, addressing the observation
    that AlexNet's first layer learned a mixture of extremely
    high-frequency and dead filters.  §4.1 attributes both changes to
    layer 1 ("we (i) reduced the 1st layer filter size from 11x11 to
    7x7 and (ii) made the stride of the convolution 2, rather than 4").
    §5.1 then describes the model as having "stride 2 convolutions in
    layers 1 & 2" — conv2's stride was *raised* from AlexNet's 1 to 2,
    which is also what Figure 3's 55 -> 26 transition requires
    arithmetically with a 5x5 kernel.  The remaining layers retain
    AlexNet's topology.

    These modest topological changes — together with the *methodology*
    of using visualisation to drive architectural choices — were
    influential out of proportion to their parameter cost.  ZFNet
    reports 16.5% top-5 validation error for the Figure 3 model
    (Table 2), and the
    deconvolutional-network analysis it popularised is the conceptual
    ancestor of every later interpretability tool from Grad-CAM to
    feature inversion.
