    V-JEPA 2-AC post-trains a V-JEPA 2 visual encoder as a latent,
    action-conditioned world model.  Each frame is encoded into its own
    spatial token grid — the three-dimensional patch embedding wants
    :math:`2` frames, so a frame is repeated to fill one tubelet.  The
    predictor interleaves an action token and a state token before every
    grid, applies a frame-causal transformer, and emits the next latent
    grid.  The visual target is kept in representation space, so
    the model predicts the consequences of an action without rendering pixels.

    The released action-conditioned checkpoint contains one ViT-g/16 variant
    with a 1024-wide, 24-layer predictor and seven-dimensional robot action
    and state vectors.  Its encoder uses the ViT-g wide MLP ratio, while the
    predictor retains the released four-times expansion.

    Attention is *frame-causal* rather than token-causal: every token of a
    step attends to every token of that step and of the ones before it, and
    to nothing after.  A step is therefore a unit of time rather than a
    position in a sequence, and the conditioning tokens sit inside it —
    action first, then state, then the spatial grid.  The action and state
    tokens are rotated only along the time axis, since they have no place in
    the spatial grid, which is what separates this attention from the
    encoder's.

    The training signal is next-frame prediction in representation space:
    the predictor is given the latents of frames up to :math:`t` and the
    action taken at :math:`t`, and is scored against the latents of frame
    :math:`t + 1`, both sides layer-normalised.  Scoring against the same
    frame instead would be satisfied by copying the input, which the causal
    mask already permits.  Planning and controller search are consumers of
    this latent transition model, not additional network layers — the
    forward is one transition, and a rollout is that forward applied to its
    own output.

    r"""Frozen architecture configuration for V-JEPA 2-AC.

    Inputs use Lucid's video convention ``(B, T, C, H, W)``.  The encoder
    is applied independently to each frame, producing ``T`` action-model
    steps — one per frame, which is the rate the released checkpoint was
    post-trained at.

    ``num_frames`` records the released clip length and sizes
    :attr:`token_grid`; it does not constrain a call.  One action-model
    step is one frame — the released loop repeats each frame to fill the
    encoder's tubelet — so a rollout is as long as the actions handed to
    it and any frame count of two or more is valid.

    ``normalize_targets`` layer-normalises the latents on both sides of
    the transition loss, which the released post-training does.
