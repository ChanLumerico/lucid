r"""Genie — a world model learned from videos with no actions in them.

Three networks, each a spatiotemporal transformer.

The **video tokenizer** is a VQ-VAE over patches: it turns each frame into
a grid of codes from a 1024-entry codebook, and back.  Its temporal
attention is causal, so a frame's codes carry what the frames before it
showed.

The **latent action model** is what makes Genie possible.  Its encoder
reads the video and names each transition with one of eight codes; its
decoder has to rebuild the next frame from the frames before it and that
code alone.  Eight codes cannot carry a frame, so they learn to carry the
one thing the past does not predict — what the player did.

The **dynamics model** is a MaskGIT transformer over the tokenizer's
codes.  It fills in a masked frame from the frames before it plus the
embedding of a latent action, and at play time it reveals a frame over
several steps, most confident tokens first.

Each is trained on its own objective.  The dynamics model reads the
tokenizer's codes, which are indices and carry no gradient, and the latent
actions under a stop-gradient, so one ``backward`` on the summed loss
still reaches each network only through its own term.

    tokenizer : Module

    Notes
    -----
    Reference: Bruce et al., ICML 2024, Section 2.

    The paper trains the tokenizer first and the other two after it, on
    its codes.  ``forward`` computes all three objectives in one pass;
    staging is a matter of which parameter group an optimiser is given —
    :meth:`tokenizer_parameters`, :meth:`latent_action_parameters` and
    :meth:`dynamics_parameters`.

    Videos are ``(B, T, C, H, W)`` in ``[0, 1]`` with

    of the latent action model is needed only to fill in the actions
    *between* prompt frames, which a prompt of one frame does not have —
    Section 2.2 replays a real video that way, from its first frame and
    the actions the model infers from it.  Each frame is revealed over
    ``maskgit_steps`` steps at ``temperature``: at every step each still
    masked token is sampled, and the most confident samples are kept, so
    many remain masked under a cosine schedule until the last step
    reveals them all.  The schedule and the confidence rule are MaskGIT's
    — *not stated* in the paper.

    The model remembers ``num_frames`` frames, as the paper's does.  A
    longer rollout keeps the most recent ones — *not stated*; Section 5
    names the 16-frame memory as a limitation and says nothing more.
