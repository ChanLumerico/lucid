"""Registry factories for DreamerV2.

The paper tunes two settings, and both ship — the same shape as
``ddpm_cifar`` / ``ddpm_lsun`` / ``ddpm_imagenet64``, which are dataset
configurations rather than size variants:

    * ``dreamer_v2``       — the released ``defaults`` block.
    * ``dreamer_v2_atari`` — discrete actions, a 600-unit state, and the
      paper's Atari divergence and discount.
    * ``dreamer_v2_dmc``   — continuous actions, a 200-unit state, and no
      discount head, because the Control Suite does not terminate.

Each has a ``_world_model`` counterpart carrying the objectives.  Set
``action_dim`` for your environment at ``create_model`` time — for Atari
that is how many buttons the game has.

The released ``crafter`` configuration is deliberately absent: it is a
later addition to the repository rather than something the paper reports,
and this zoo ships paper-cited configurations only.

What is *not* here is the parts of those configurations that are not the
model — action repeat, replay prefill, reward clipping and the learning
rates.  No config in this zoo carries them; ``action_repeat`` belongs to
:mod:`lucid.utils.rollout`, and the rates are quoted in
:class:`DreamerV2Config`'s Notes.

No parameter count is registered — the paper reports 20M for the world
model without breaking it down, and the docs site introspects the real
figure anyway.
