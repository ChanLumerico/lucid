"""DreamerV2 configuration — Hafner et al., 2021.

The change that names the paper is the latent: a grid of categorical
variables in place of Dreamer's diagonal Gaussian.  Everything else —
the actor, the critic, the imagined lambda-returns — is inherited, then
adjusted for the fact that the latent is now discrete.

Defaults are the released implementation's ``defaults`` block, which is
the configuration it ships rather than either of the two the paper tunes.
The Atari and DeepMind Control settings are tabulated in the class Notes
so nothing is lost by not picking one.

    DreamerV2 keeps its predecessor's shape — a recurrent state-space
    model, an actor and a critic trained on imagined trajectories — and
    changes what the stochastic latent *is*.  Where Dreamer draws
    :math:`s_t` from a diagonal Gaussian, this draws a grid of
    **categorical** variables: 32 of them, 32 classes each, sampled as
    one-hots.  The state is then a sparse binary vector of length 1024
    with exactly 32 bits set.

    A one-hot sample has no gradient, so the paper takes the
    **straight-through** estimator — the same device that makes vector
    quantisation trainable:

    .. math::

        \tilde{s} = \mathrm{sample} + p - \mathrm{sg}(p),

    which passes the sample forward and the class probabilities' gradient
    backward.

    The motivation the paper gives is representational rather than
    computational.  A Gaussian latent must describe a multi-modal future —
    a ball that will bounce left *or* right — with a single mean, and so
    describes neither; a categorical one can put mass on both outcomes and
    keep them apart.  Atari is full of such futures, which is where the
    Gaussian model had been losing.

    The second change is to the divergence.  A single KL term makes the
    prior chase the posterior and the posterior chase the prior at the
    same rate, and the paper observes the posterior giving way — it
    collapses toward a prior that has not learned anything yet.  **KL
    balancing** splits the term and weights the two directions
    separately:

    .. math::

        \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{KL}} =
            \alpha\, \mathrm{KL}\big(\mathrm{sg}(q) \,\|\, p\big)
            + (1 - \alpha)\, \mathrm{KL}\big(q \,\|\, \mathrm{sg}(p)\big),

    with :math:`\alpha = 0.8`.  Most of the pressure is on the prior to
    explain what the posterior saw, and only a fifth on the posterior to
    stay predictable — which is the asymmetry that keeps the latent
    carrying the observation.

    Two smaller changes complete it.  The critic regresses onto a **target
    network** refreshed every hundred steps, so its own moving estimate
    does not chase itself.  And the actor's gradient can come either
    through the dynamics, as before, or from a score-function estimator;
    the paper uses the analytic path for continuous control and REINFORCE
    for Atari, where the actions are discrete and there is no path to
    differentiate.

    r"""Frozen configuration for the DreamerV2 family.

    Defaults follow the released implementation's ``defaults`` block.
    Fields shared with PlaNet and Dreamer are inherited from
    :class:`WorldModelConfig`, and the ones this paper changes are
    re-declared here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    act_fn : {"silu", "swish", "relu", "gelu", "elu"}, default="elu"
        Activation throughout, as in Dreamer.
    stoch_size : int, default=32
        Number of categorical variables.  Note the change of meaning: in
        the Gaussian families this is the *width* of the latent vector,
        here it is how many independent categoricals make it up.
    discrete : int, default=32
        Classes per categorical variable.  The stochastic state is
        therefore ``stoch_size * discrete`` wide — 1024 by default, of
        which exactly ``stoch_size`` entries are 1.
    deter_size, hidden_size : int, default=1024, 1024
        Deterministic path and the RSSM heads' hidden width.
    cnn_depth : int, default=48
        First encoder convolution's width; the schedule is Dreamer's.
    free_nats : float, default=0.0
        Off by default — KL balancing does the job free nats was doing,
        and the released implementation sets it to zero.
    kl_weight : float, default=1.0
        Multiplier on the balanced divergence.
    kl_balance : float, default=0.8
        :math:`\alpha` — the share of the divergence that pulls the prior
        toward the posterior rather than the reverse.
    reward_hidden, reward_layers : int, default=400, 4
        Reward head.
    actor_hidden, actor_layers : int, default=400, 4
        Actor.
    value_hidden, value_layers : int, default=400, 4
        Critic.
    horizon : int, default=15
        Imagination horizon.
    discount : float, default=0.99
        Reward discount :math:`\gamma`.
    lambda_ : float, default=0.95
        TD(:math:`\lambda`) weighting.
    actor_grad : {"dynamics", "reinforce", "mix"}, default="dynamics"
        How the actor's gradient is estimated.  The released
        implementation's ``auto`` resolves to ``"dynamics"`` for
        continuous actions and ``"reinforce"`` for discrete ones; since
        this family emits continuous actions, that resolution is the
        default here.
    actor_grad_mix : float, default=0.1
        Weight on the dynamics term when ``actor_grad="mix"``.
    actor_entropy : float, default=2e-3
        Coefficient on the actor's entropy bonus.
    actor_min_std : float, default=0.1
        Floor on the action distribution's scale.
    slow_target_update : int, default=100
        Gradient steps between refreshes of the critic's target copy.
    slow_target_fraction : float, default=1.0
        Fraction of the way the target moves at each refresh; ``1`` is a
        hard copy.
    pcont : bool, default=True
        Predict the discount.  Unlike Dreamer this is **on** by default —
        the paper's headline domain is Atari, where episodes end.
    pcont_scale : float, default=1.0
        Multiplier on the discount head's likelihood.
    pcont_layers : int, default=4
        Depth of the discount head; width follows ``value_hidden``.

    The paper tunes two configurations, and the released implementation
    keeps both as overrides on the defaults used here:

    ==================  ==========  ==========  ============
    field               default     Atari       DMC (vision)
    ==================  ==========  ==========  ============
    ``deter_size``      1024        600         200
    ``hidden_size``     1024        600         200
    ``kl_weight``       1.0         0.1         1.0
    ``discount``        0.99        0.999       0.99
    ``actor_entropy``   2e-3        1e-3        1e-4
    ``pcont``           True        True        False
    ``pcont_scale``     1.0         5.0         1.0
    ==================  ==========  ==========  ============

    Learning rates are not config fields — no model config in this zoo
    carries them — but for the record the paper's are ``2e-4`` (world),
    ``4e-5`` (actor) and ``1e-4`` (critic) for Atari, against the released
    defaults of ``1e-4`` / ``8e-5`` / ``2e-4``.

    ``stoch_size`` changing meaning between this family and the Gaussian
    ones is deliberate: it is the same *slot* in the shared config — how
    much stochastic state there is — and re-naming it would break the
    inheritance for the sake of a word.  What it costs is that
    :attr:`latent_size` is no longer ``deter_size + stoch_size``, which is
    why this class overrides it.
