    Parameters
    ----------
    posterior, prior : RSSMState
        Both categorical, from the same step.
    dyn_scale, rep_scale : float, default=1.0, 0.1
        :math:`\beta_{\mathrm{dyn}}` and :math:`\beta_{\mathrm{rep}}`.
    free_nats : float, default=1.0
        The floor.  Below it a term contributes a constant, so no gradient
        is spent closing a gap that is already small.

    Returns
    -------
    dynamics, representation : Tensor
        Scalars, already scaled.  Returned apart because they are the two
        halves the paper reports separately and the pair is what a reader
        checks when a latent collapses.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If either state is Gaussian.

    The clip is applied **per step, before averaging**, which is the whole
    point and easy to get backwards.  Clipping the mean lets a batch where
    most steps are already below the floor be dragged by a few that are
    not; clipping each step first means those steps simply stop
    contributing.  DreamerV2's ``free_nats`` clipped the mean, and that
    difference is part of why this one does not need a tuned KL scale.

    --------

    >>> from lucid.models.generative._common._rssm import RSSMState

    (1.0, 1.0)

    Two terms rather than v2's single balanced one, each clamped at the
    free-nats floor on its own. Returning them apart is what lets the
    two be scaled differently — v3 weights the dynamics term far above
    the representation one.

def percentile(values: Tensor, fraction: float) -> Tensor:

    Parameters
    ----------
    values : Tensor
        Any shape; flattened first.
    fraction : float
        In ``[0, 100]``.

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor
        A scalar, by nearest-rank on the sorted values.

    Notes
    -----
    Nearest-rank rather than interpolated.  The consumer is a scale
    estimate smoothed by a long moving average, so the difference between
    the two conventions is far below the noise the average is there to
    remove, and nearest-rank needs no gather.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import lucid
    >>> from lucid.models.generative.dreamer_v3._objectives import percentile
    >>> values = lucid.tensor([float(i) for i in range(1, 101)])
    >>> float(percentile(values, 95).item())
    95.0

    ``fraction`` is in [0, 100], not [0, 1] — 0.5 asks for the half-th
    percentile and returns the smallest value, not the median.

class ReturnNormaliser(nn.Module):
    r"""A slow estimate of how wide the returns currently are.

    Parameters
    ----------
    decay : float, default=0.99
        Weight kept by the running estimate at each update.
    low, high : float, default=5.0, 95.0
        Percentiles whose difference is the spread.
    floor : float, default=1.0
        The divisor is ``max(floor, spread)``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    spread : Tensor
        The running estimate, a 0-d buffer.

    Notes
    -----
    DreamerV3 divides the actor's objective by

    .. math::

        S = \mathrm{EMA}\big(\mathrm{Per}(R^\lambda, 95)
                           - \mathrm{Per}(R^\lambda, 5),\; 0.99\big),

    which is what lets a single entropy coefficient mean the same thing
    in a domain where returns are 0.01 and one where they are 10000 —
    the bonus is traded against a quantity that has been made
    dimensionless.

    Two details carry the design.  The **percentile range** rather than
    the standard deviation, because a handful of enormous returns should
    not shrink every other gradient.  And the **floor at one**, because
    dividing by a genuinely small spread would amplify what is mostly
    noise: below that width the returns are left in their own units.

    The estimate is a tensor updated in place, not a Python float read
    back from the device each step: that read stalled every step on a
    device sync and made a compiled training step impossible, since a
    value read on the host is frozen into the compiled graph.  It is a
    *non-persistent* buffer — it follows the model across devices, but it
    is a statistic of the current returns, not a weight, and stays out of
    ``state_dict``.
