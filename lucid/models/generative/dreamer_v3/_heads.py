r"""Distributional regression heads — predict a distribution, read a scalar.

DreamerV3 predicts reward and value as categorical distributions over
exponentially spaced bins rather than as numbers.  Two reasons, and the
first is the one the paper is built on.

A squared error's gradient is proportional to the error, so a head fitted
to rewards around ``1`` and a head fitted to rewards around ``10000``
receive gradients four orders of magnitude apart, and no single learning
rate suits both.  A cross-entropy's gradient is bounded regardless, which
is what lets one configuration span domains.

The second is representational: the mean of a squared-error head is a
single number, so a genuinely bimodal outcome — a value that is either 0
or 10 — is fitted as 5, which never happens.  A distribution can hold
both and still report 5 when asked for a point estimate.

Kept private to the family.  It is a general idea and a reasonable
candidate for promotion, but it has one consumer.

class TwoHotHead(nn.Module):
    r"""A dense trunk whose output is a distribution over symlog bins.

    Parameters
    ----------
    in_features : int
        Width of the latent it reads.
    hidden, layers : int
        Shape of the dense trunk.
    num_bins : int, default=41
        Bins in the output distribution.
    bin_range : float, default=20.0
        The grid spans ``[-bin_range, bin_range]`` **in symlog space**, so
        it reaches ``symexp(bin_range)`` in the target's own units —
        about 5e8 at the default, which is why one grid covers every
        domain the paper reports.
    act_fn : str, default="silu"
        Activation in the trunk.
    zero_init : bool, default=False
        Start the output layer at zero, so the head predicts exactly
        ``symexp(0) = 0`` before it has learned anything.  The paper does
        this for the critic: a value function that begins by asserting
        large returns sends the actor chasing them.

    Notes
    -----
    The grid is uniform in symlog space and therefore exponential in the
    target's, which is the whole trick — near zero the bins are dense and
    far out they are sparse, matching where precision is worth spending.

    Reading a scalar back is the grid's expectation put through
    ``symexp``.  Note this is *not* the same as the mode: a bimodal
    prediction reports its mean, which is the answer to "what should I
    expect", the question a value function is asked.
