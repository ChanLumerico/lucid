"""DreamerV3 configuration — Hafner et al., 2023.

The paper's claim is not a new mechanism but the absence of one: the same
hyperparameters solve Atari, DeepMind Control, Minecraft and the rest,
with no per-domain tuning.  Everything here exists to make that true —
transforms that flatten the scale of rewards, a divergence that cannot
collapse, and an actor objective normalised by its own return spread.

Defaults are the paper's, at the size whose categorical grid matches the
32x32 it describes.  The scaling ladder is a table below rather than a
knob, because the released implementation moves five quantities together.

    DreamerV3's contribution is that its hyperparameters stop mattering.
    Its predecessors needed a different divergence scale for Atari than
    for continuous control, a different entropy bonus, a different
    discount; this one setting spans them, and the paper's headline
    result — collecting diamonds in Minecraft from scratch — is run with
    the same numbers as everything else.

    Four changes buy that, and each removes a scale the practitioner was
    otherwise forced to supply.

    **Symlog.** Rewards differ by orders of magnitude between domains, and
    a network fitted to one range is wrong on another.  Compressing them
    through :math:`\mathrm{sign}(x)\ln(|x| + 1)` leaves small values
    alone and folds large ones in, so the same head covers both.

    **Two-hot regression.** Reward and value heads predict a
    *distribution* over exponentially spaced bins rather than a number.
    A squared error's gradient scales with the error, which is precisely
    the coupling to reward magnitude the paper is trying to break; a
    cross-entropy's does not.  It also lets a prediction be bimodal,
    which the mean of a squared-error head cannot represent.

    **Free bits.** The divergence is clipped below at one nat per
    variable:

    .. math::

        \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{dyn}} = \max\big(1,\;
            \mathrm{KL}[\mathrm{sg}(q) \,\|\, p]\big),
        \qquad
        \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{rep}} = \max\big(1,\;
            \mathrm{KL}[q \,\|\, \mathrm{sg}(p)\big]),

    weighted :math:`\beta_{\mathrm{dyn}} = 1` and
    :math:`\beta_{\mathrm{rep}} = 0.1`.  Below one nat the term is flat,
    so no gradient is spent closing a gap that is already small — which
    is what stopped the posterior collapsing and made the KL scale a
    tuning knob in the first place.  The categoricals are also mixed with
    1% uniform, so no class can reach probability zero and strand its
    gradient.

    **Normalised returns.** The actor divides its objective by the spread
    of its own recent returns,

    .. math::

        S = \mathrm{EMA}\big(\mathrm{Per}(R^\lambda, 95)
                           - \mathrm{Per}(R^\lambda, 5),\; 0.99\big),

    dividing by :math:`\max(1, S)` so that small returns are left alone
    rather than amplified into noise.  A fixed entropy bonus then means
    the same thing in every domain, because the thing it is traded
    against has been made scale-free.

    r"""Frozen configuration for the DreamerV3 family.

    Defaults are the paper's values at the ``50m`` rung of the scaling
    ladder, whose 32-class categorical grid is the one the paper
    describes.  Fields shared with the earlier world models are inherited
    from :class:`WorldModelConfig`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    act_fn : {"silu", "swish", "relu", "gelu", "elu"}, default="silu"
        Activation throughout.  DreamerV2 used ELU; this uses SiLU.
    stoch_size : int, default=32
        Number of categorical variables.
    discrete : int, default=32
        Classes per variable.
    deter_size, hidden_size : int, default=4096, 512
        Deterministic path and the RSSM heads' hidden width.
    cnn_depth : int, default=32
        First encoder convolution's width.
    unimix : float, default=0.01
        Uniform mass mixed into every categorical.  Keeps a class from
        reaching probability zero, where its gradient would vanish.
    free_nats : float, default=1.0
        Free bits — the divergence is flat below this, per step.  One nat
        is the paper's value, and the reason it no longer needs tuning.
    kl_weight : float, default=1.0
        Overall multiplier on the divergence, on top of the split below.
    dyn_scale, rep_scale : float, default=1.0, 0.1
        :math:`\beta_{\mathrm{dyn}}` and :math:`\beta_{\mathrm{rep}}` —
        how hard the prior is pulled toward the posterior against the
        reverse.  The asymmetry is DreamerV2's KL balancing, restated.
    pred_scale : float, default=1.0
        :math:`\beta_{\mathrm{pred}}` on the reconstruction, reward and
        continuation likelihoods.
    num_bins : int, default=41
        Bins in the reward and value heads' two-hot output.
    bin_range : float, default=20.0
        The grid spans ``[-bin_range, +bin_range]`` in symlog space, so in
        reward units it reaches ``symexp(20)`` — roughly 5e8.
    reward_hidden, reward_layers : int, default=512, 3
        Reward head.
    actor_hidden, actor_layers : int, default=512, 3
        Actor.
    value_hidden, value_layers : int, default=512, 3
        Critic.
    horizon : int, default=16
        Imagination horizon.
    discount : float, default=0.997
        Reward discount.  Stated as a horizon of 333 steps in the
        released configuration, which is the same number.
    lambda_ : float, default=0.95
        TD(:math:`\lambda`) weighting.
    actor_entropy : float, default=3e-4
        Entropy bonus.  Fixed across domains, which only works because
        the returns it competes with are normalised.
    return_ema_decay : float, default=0.99
        Decay of the moving return-spread estimate.
    return_low, return_high : float, default=5.0, 95.0
        Percentiles whose difference is that spread.
    critic_ema : float, default=0.02
        Rate at which the critic's slow copy follows it.  DreamerV2 used
        a hard copy every hundred steps; this is a continuous average.
    replay_value_scale : float, default=0.3
        Weight on the critic's loss over *replayed* trajectories, in
        addition to imagined ones.
    action_space : {"continuous", "discrete"}, default="continuous"
        What an action is, as in DreamerV2.

    The scaling ladder moves five quantities together, so it is a table
    rather than a knob — see :data:`DREAMER_V3_SIZES` and the factories

    The released implementation has drifted past the paper — its current
    defaults are the ``200m`` rung with eight-block recurrence and RMS
    normalisation, none of which the paper reports.  Where the two
    disagree the paper is followed, as it is for the earlier families.
