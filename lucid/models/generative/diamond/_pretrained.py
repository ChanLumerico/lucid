"""Registry factories for DIAMOND.

One architecture, so one nominal name — the paper trains the same
configuration across all 26 Atari games, and H11 allows a size suffix
only where a paper puts a variant table.  The *weights* are per game,
which is a tag rather than a factory.

The appendix scales the world model up for *Counter-Strike* and motorway
driving and reports 122M parameters, but gives no architecture for it:
no channel widths, no depths, nothing that would let the number be
reproduced rather than guessed.  What it does state is the conditioning
length, :math:`L = 6`, which is a configuration override —
``diamond(conditioning_frames=6)``.

``params`` is registered at the released count.  The architecture here
is the released one rather than the paper's prose, which under-specifies
it in four places, so the number a factory builds is exactly what the
published checkpoints hold.

    head and both action embeddings are built to it.  Loading an agent

    the tag carries the number and it is applied here rather than left
    for the caller to look up.
