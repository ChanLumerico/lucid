"""Pretrained-weight declarations for the DiT family.

Two checkpoints were released, and they are the same model: the XL
backbone at patch 2, trained on class-conditional ImageNet, at the two
resolutions the paper reports state-of-the-art FID for.  The other
eleven configurations in the scaling study were trained but never
published, which is why ``dit_xlarge_2`` is the only factory here that
takes ``pretrained``.

The weights are converted by :mod:`tools.convert_weights.dit` from the
``facebook/DiT-XL-2-*`` repos and re-hosted under the ``lucid-dl`` org.

Two things a caller needs to know before using them.

**The licence is non-commercial.**  The architecture is not encumbered,
but these tensors carry CC-BY-NC-4.0 from their source and a converted
copy does not launder that.

**A DiT emits a latent, not an image.**  The paper works in the latent
space of "the off-the-shelf pre-trained VAE from Stable Diffusion" — the
``sd-vae-ft-ema`` finetune — so turning ``generate()``'s output into
pixels takes that decoder.  Lucid already implements it, as
:class:`~lucid.models.generative.stable_diffusion.AutoencoderKL`, and
the configuration it defaults to is exactly the one these checkpoints
were trained against.

    here, DiT is class-conditional, and the label embedding carries one

    Notes
    -----
    Reference: Peebles and Xie, ICCV 2023 (arXiv:2212.09748), Table 2
    and Table 3.  The reported FIDs — 2.27 at 256 and 3.04 at 512 — are
    measured with classifier-free guidance at scale 1.5 over **250 DDPM
    sampling steps**, which :meth:`DiTForImageGeneration.generate` reaches
    as ``steps=250, eta=1.0``; the default ``eta=0.0`` is DDIM's
    deterministic step, matching the released pipeline's scheduler but
    not the protocol behind those numbers.

    The two tags differ only in the latent they were trained on — a
    32-side latent for 256-pixel images and 64 for 512 — so the 512 tag
    needs a model built at that size, which its factory override does.
    Their parameter counts are identical, because the positional table
    that grows with the latent is a non-persistent buffer rather than a
    parameter and is rebuilt from the config on construction.
