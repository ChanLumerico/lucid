"""DiT configuration — Peebles & Xie, ICCV 2023.

The diffusion model that stopped using a U-Net.  DDPM, NCSN and the
latent diffusion models that followed all denoise with a convolutional
U-Net; DiT replaces it with a plain Vision Transformer over latent
patches and finds that the substitution is not merely viable but better
behaved — FID falls monotonically with the backbone's Gflops, whether
those come from depth, width, or a smaller patch.

The paper's contribution is as much a negative result as a positive one.
Nothing about the U-Net's inductive bias turned out to be necessary; what
mattered was how the conditioning entered the network, and the answer —
adaLN-Zero — is a few lines rather than an architecture.

    A diffusion model needs a network that maps a noised latent and a
    timestep to a prediction of the noise.  Nothing about that job
    requires convolutions, and DiT tests the claim directly: patchify the
    latent into a sequence, run a standard Vision Transformer over it,
    and decode back.

    .. math::

        z \in \mathbb{R}^{I \times I \times C}
        \;\longrightarrow\;
        T = (I / p)^2 \text{ tokens of width } d
        \;\longrightarrow\;
        p \times p \times 2C \text{ per token}

    The decoder emits **twice** the input channels because the model
    predicts a noise and a diagonal covariance, following ADM's
    parameterisation of :math:`\Sigma_\theta`.

    **Where the conditioning enters is the finding.**  The paper compares
    four ways of admitting the timestep and class label and they are not
    close.  In-context conditioning appends them as tokens; cross
    attention gives them their own attention layer at about 15% more
    compute; adaptive layer norm regresses a per-channel shift and scale
    from their sum; and adaLN-Zero adds a third regressed vector, a gate
    :math:`\alpha` applied immediately before each residual add:

    .. math::

        x \leftarrow x + \alpha \cdot \mathrm{sublayer}\bigl(
            (1 + \gamma)\,\mathrm{LN}(x) + \beta \bigr).

    Initialising the projection that produces :math:`\alpha` at zero makes
    every block the identity at step zero.  That single change roughly
    halves the FID of the in-context variant at 400K steps, and it is the
    cheapest of the four in Gflops.

    **Scale is the other finding.**  Across twelve models — four widths
    crossed with three patch sizes — FID correlates with the backbone's
    Gflops at :math:`-0.93`, and parameter count is *not* the predictor:
    holding parameters fixed while shrinking the patch improves FID
    substantially, because more tokens mean more compute.  Sampling
    compute does not substitute for it; a small model given eight times
    the sampling steps still loses to a large one.

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class DiTConfig(DiffusionModelConfig):
    r"""Configuration for the DiT family.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample_size : int, default=32
        Side of the latent the transformer sees — ``32`` for the
        256-pixel models and ``64`` for the 512-pixel ones, both after
        the VAE's factor-of-eight downsample.
    in_channels : int, default=4
        Latent channels.
    out_channels : int, default=8
        What the decoder emits: ``2 * in_channels``, a noise and a
        diagonal covariance.  Set it equal to ``in_channels`` for a model
        that predicts noise alone and fixes the variance.
    patch_size : int, default=2
        Side of the square patch each token covers.  The number after the
        slash in the paper's names — ``XL/2`` is the XLarge backbone at
        patch 2.  Halving it quadruples the token count and *at least*
        quadruples Gflops, which is the axis the scaling study rides.
    hidden_size : int, default=1152
        Transformer width.
    depth : int, default=28
        Number of blocks.
    num_heads : int, default=16
        Attention heads per block.
    mlp_ratio : float, default=4.0
        Feed-forward expansion.
    frequency_embedding_size : int, default=256
        Width of the sinusoid the timestep is expanded to before the
        two-layer MLP that maps it to ``hidden_size``.  The reference
        implementation fixes this at 256 independently of the model's
        width, so it is a field rather than a reuse of ``hidden_size`` —
        tying the two would add ``(hidden_size - 256) * hidden_size``
        parameters to every variant and make published checkpoints
        unloadable.
    num_classes : int, default=1000
        Label vocabulary.  Index ``num_classes`` is the null embedding
        classifier-free guidance drops to.
    class_dropout : float, default=0.1
        Probability of replacing the label with that null embedding
        during training.
    conditioning : {"adaln_zero", "adaln", "cross_attention", "in_context"}, default="adaln_zero"
        Which of the paper's four designs to build.
    learn_sigma : bool, default=True
        Whether the decoder predicts the covariance alongside the noise.
        Kept explicit because it is what makes ``out_channels`` twice
        ``in_channels``, and a reader who changes one without the other
        gets a shape error rather than an explanation.

    Notes
    -----
    Reference: Peebles and Xie, *"Scalable Diffusion Models with
    Transformers"*, ICCV, 2023 (arXiv:2212.09748).  Backbone
    configurations are Table 1; the diffusion hyperparameters are ADM's,
    which is a linear variance schedule over 1000 steps from 1e-4 to
    2e-2 — the defaults :class:`DiffusionModelConfig` already carries.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from lucid.models.generative.dit import DiTConfig
    >>> config = DiTConfig()
    >>> config.depth, config.hidden_size, config.num_heads
    (28, 1152, 16)

    The token count is what the scaling study varies, and it comes from
    the patch size rather than the width:
