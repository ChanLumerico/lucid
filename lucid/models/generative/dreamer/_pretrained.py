"""Registry factories for Dreamer.

Hafner et al., 2020 report one architecture at two settings.  Appendix A
gives the Control Suite setup in its main paragraph and then a second,
headed *Discrete control*, for Atari and DeepMind Lab.  The tasks inside
each setting differ only in action dimensionality and the action-repeat
constant — neither is a variant of the network — so under the project's
paper-cited-variants-only rule this family gets nominal names and no size
suffix:

    * ``dreamer``          — the Control Suite setting: a tanh-squashed
      Gaussian policy, 15-step horizon, unscaled divergence, no discount
      head.
    * ``dreamer_discrete`` — the *Discrete control* setting: a categorical
      policy over buttons, 10-step horizon, divergence scaled to 0.1, and a
      discount head.

Each has a ``_world_model`` counterpart carrying the objectives.  Set
``action_dim`` for your environment at ``create_model`` time — for Atari
that is how many buttons the game has.

Two things the *Discrete control* paragraph specifies are **not** model
fields and are absent here on purpose.  Its exploration is "epsilon greedy
where epsilon is linearly scheduled from 0.4 to 0.1 over the first 200,000
gradient steps", which belongs to whatever drives
:func:`lucid.utils.rollout.rollout`; and it bounds "rewards using tanh",
which is a property of the environment's reward, applied before the batch
reaches the model.  DreamerV2 draws the same line for the same two
quantities.

No parameter count is registered — the paper states no trainable-parameter
total, and the docs site introspects the real figure anyway.

    PlaNet's architecture unchanged — a four-layer stride-2 convolutional
    encoder, a recurrent state-space model with a 200-unit deterministic
    path and a 30-unit stochastic state, a mirrored decoder — plus the two
    heads that replace PlaNet's planner: a ``tanh``-squashed Gaussian actor
    and a scalar critic, each three 300-unit ELU layers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pretrained : bool, default=False
        No weights are published for this family; passing ``True`` raises
        rather than returning a randomly initialised model.
    **overrides : object
        Optional :class:`DreamerConfig` field overrides.  ``action_dim`` is
        the one you almost always need — it is set by the environment, not
        by the paper.

    pretrained : bool, default=False
        No weights are published for this family; passing ``True`` raises.
    **overrides : object
        Optional :class:`DreamerConfig` field overrides.  ``horizon``,

    The action is sampled with straight-through gradients, as the paper
    specifies.  That is a biased estimator, and it is the one this paper
    used; DreamerV2 later replaced it with the score function for discrete
    actions.

    Epsilon-greedy exploration and tanh reward bounding belong to the
    rollout and the environment respectively — see this module's docstring.
