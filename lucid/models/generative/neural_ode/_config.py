    A residual network updates its state in discrete jumps,
    :math:`h_{t+1} = h_t + f(h_t, \theta_t)`.  Shrink the jump and add a
    step size and that recurrence is Euler's method; take the step to zero
    and the network stops being a sequence of layers and becomes a
    *differential equation*,

    .. math::

        \frac{d\mathbf{z}(t)}{dt} = f(\mathbf{z}(t), t, \theta),

    whose solution at :math:`t_1` is whatever an ODE solver says it is.
    Depth is no longer a hyper-parameter but an accuracy request handed to
    the solver, and the memory the backward pass needs stops growing with
    it — the adjoint method reconstructs what it needs by integrating
    backwards rather than storing every intermediate state.

    What that buys a generative model is **Theorem 1**, the instantaneous
    change of variables.  A discrete flow pays for every bijection with the
    log-determinant of its Jacobian, which is why NICE and RealNVP go to
    such lengths to keep that Jacobian triangular.  A continuous flow pays
    with a trace instead:

    .. math::

        \frac{\partial \log p(\mathbf{z}(t))}{\partial t}
            = -\operatorname{tr}\!\left(
                \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{z}(t)}\right).

    A determinant constrains the *architecture*; a trace does not.  The
    vector field can be any network at all — no masking, no ordering of the
    dimensions, no triangular structure — and the density still comes out
    exactly, by integrating the state and its log-density together as one
    augmented system.

    The paper's vector field is a sum of :math:`M` functions with learned
    time-dependent gates, :math:`d\mathbf{z}/dt = \sum_n \sigma_n(t)
    f_n(\mathbf{z})` with :math:`\sigma_n(t) \in (0, 1)` — a hypernetwork,
    so that the dynamics themselves change as the flow proceeds rather than
    being one fixed map applied for longer.

    Computing the trace exactly costs one vector-Jacobian product per
    dimension, which is why the paper's experiments are two-dimensional
    density matching.  Replacing it with the Hutchinson estimator,

    .. math::

        \operatorname{tr}(A) = \mathbb{E}_{p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})}
            \left[\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{\mathsf{T}} A
                  \boldsymbol{\epsilon}\right],
        \qquad
        \mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{\epsilon}] = \mathbf{0},\;
        \operatorname{Cov}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}) = I,

    turns that per-dimension cost into a single product for an unbiased
    estimate, and is what lets the same flow run on images — the step
    Grathwohl et al. take in FFJORD (*"FFJORD: Free-Form Continuous
    Dynamics for Scalable Reversible Generative Models"*, ICLR 2019).  Both
    are available here; ``trace_method`` chooses, and the default follows
    the dimension.

class NeuralODEConfig(NormalizingFlowConfig):
    r"""Frozen configuration for every Neural ODE (CNF) variant.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample_size : int or tuple of int, default=32
        Spatial resolution of a sample.  The flow itself is defined on the
        flattened vector, so this and ``in_channels`` only fix its width.
    in_channels : int, default=3
        Channels per sample.
    out_channels : int, default=3
        Kept equal to ``in_channels``: the flow is a bijection, so it
        cannot change the dimension it acts on.
    act_fn : {"silu", "swish", "relu", "gelu"}, default="silu"
        Activation between the vector field's gated blocks.  A smooth one
        is worth preferring here for a reason that does not apply to a
        discrete flow: the solver estimates its own error from how
        polynomial the trajectory looks locally, so a kinked right-hand
        side costs steps.
    prior : {"logistic", "gaussian"}, default="gaussian"
        Base distribution the latent is measured against.  Unlike the
        discrete flows, which use a logistic prior on dequantised pixels,
        the continuous flow integrates to a standard normal.
    hidden_dim : int, default=64
        Width :math:`M` of each function in the gated sum — the paper's CNF
        experiments use ``64``.
    num_blocks : int, default=2
        How many gated blocks the vector field stacks.
    solver : str, default="dopri5"
        Method name handed to :func:`lucid.diffeq.odeint`.  Any adaptive
        method works; the fixed-step ones trade accuracy for a predictable
        cost per sample.
    rtol, atol : float, default=1e-5, 1e-5
        Solver tolerances.  Looser than the ``lucid.diffeq`` defaults on
        purpose: the flow is trained, so solving it to twelve digits buys
        nothing the gradient can use.
    use_adjoint : bool, default=True
        Integrate the backward pass with :func:`lucid.diffeq.odeint_adjoint`
        rather than differentiating through the solver's own steps.  This is
        the paper's constant-memory result; turning it off costs memory
        proportional to the number of steps taken but gives gradients that
        are exact for the discretisation actually used.
    trace_method : {"exact", "hutchinson"} or None, default=None
        How the divergence is obtained.  ``None`` picks by dimension —
        exact below ``exact_trace_max_dim``, Hutchinson above it — so the
        default is the paper's method exactly where the paper's method is
        affordable.
    trace_noise : {"rademacher", "gaussian"}, default="rademacher"
        Probe distribution for the Hutchinson estimate.
    exact_trace_max_dim : int, default=32
        Dimension below which ``trace_method=None`` resolves to ``"exact"``.

    Notes
    -----
    ``in_channels`` and ``out_channels`` must agree: a flow is a bijection.
