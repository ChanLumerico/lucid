"""Neural ODE model — a continuous normalizing flow (Chen et al., 2018).

Shape of the flow, in order:

    x (B, C, H, W)
      → flatten to z(0) of shape (B, D)
      → integrate [z, Δ] from t = 0 to t = 1 under
            dz/dt = f(t, z),      dΔ/dt = tr(∂f/∂z)
      → z(1) is the latent, Δ(1) is the flow's log-determinant

Nothing about that is a stack of layers.  There is one vector field, and
:mod:`lucid.diffeq` decides how many evaluations of it the requested
accuracy needs — which is why :attr:`NeuralODEModel.nfe` is worth
watching during training, and why ``decode`` needs no hand-written
inverse: it is the same field integrated from ``t = 1`` back to ``t = 0``.

    The paper writes the dynamics as a sum of functions with learned
    time-dependent gates in :math:`(0, 1)` — a hypernetwork, so that what
    the field *does* changes along the trajectory instead of being one
    fixed map applied for longer.  Here the gate scales the block's linear
    response and a second time-driven term shifts it, which is the form
    that makes :math:`t` reach every unit rather than only the first
    layer.

    Only the ``z`` term is a matrix product.  The two time-driven terms
    take a *scalar* input, so writing them as dense layers would put two
    ``(1, 1) x (1, out)`` GEMMs on the hot path for every stage of every
    step — pure dispatch overhead, and measurably the largest single cost
    in the right-hand side.  Broadcasting a parameter against ``t``

    r"""Continuous normalizing flow — the generative half of Chen et al., 2018.

    ``encode`` integrates the augmented system forward and returns the
    latent together with the flow's log-determinant; ``decode`` integrates
    the same vector field with time reversed.  That symmetry is the point
    of the continuous formulation: a discrete flow has to be *built*
    invertible, whereas this one is invertible because an ODE is, and the
    inverse is the solver run backwards.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : NeuralODEConfig
        Field width and depth, solver and tolerances, and how the trace is
        obtained.

    Attributes
    ----------
    dynamics : _CNFDynamics

        evaluation counter.

    Notes
    -----
    Reference: Chen, Rubanova, Bettencourt, and Duvenaud, *"Neural
    Ordinary Differential Equations"*, NeurIPS, 2018 (arXiv:1806.07366),
    §4.  The Hutchinson trace option follows Grathwohl et al., *"FFJORD"*,
    ICLR, 2019 (arXiv:1810.01367).

    **Where to run it.**  A solve is one small right-hand side evaluated
    tens of times, so which stream wins depends entirely on how much work
    each evaluation carries.  Measured on an M1 Pro, one training step
    (forward, loss, backward) of ``neural_ode_gen``:

    ==================  ===========  ===========
    setup               ``"cpu"``    ``"metal"``
    ==================  ===========  ===========
    B=8, D=192            16.8 ms      38.1 ms
    B=32, D=3072         175.0 ms      56.5 ms
    B=128, D=3072        587.5 ms      70.8 ms
    ==================  ===========  ===========

    Below a few hundred dimensions the tensors are too small to pay for a
    GPU dispatch and Accelerate wins; at anything resembling a real
    training batch the ratio reverses and keeps widening — ``8.3x`` at the
    bottom row, where the CPU cost grows with the batch and the GPU's
    barely does.  Train on ``"metal"``; keep the paper's two-dimensional
    density experiments on ``"cpu"``.

class NeuralODEForImageGeneration(PretrainedModel):
    r"""Neural ODE flow with a training loss and ``.generate()``.

    ``forward(x)`` returns a :class:`NormalizingFlowOutput` whose ``loss``
    is the mean negative log-likelihood in **bits per dimension**, the
    scale-free form that keeps the gradient magnitude independent of how
    wide the data is.  ``generate(n_samples)`` draws
    :math:`z \sim p_Z` and integrates the field backwards to ``t = 0``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : NeuralODEConfig
        Architecture, solver and trace-estimator knobs.

    Attributes
    ----------
    neural_ode : NeuralODEModel
        Underlying flow, exposing ``encode`` / ``decode`` / ``log_prob`` /
        ``bits_per_dim``.

    Notes
    -----
    Reference: Chen, Rubanova, Bettencourt, and Duvenaud, *"Neural
    Ordinary Differential Equations"*, NeurIPS, 2018 (arXiv:1806.07366).
    The paper's own continuous-flow experiments are two-dimensional
    density matching rather than images; sampling at image scale is what
    the Hutchinson trace of Grathwohl et al. (ICLR 2019) makes affordable,
    and is what ``trace_method`` selects by default above
    ``exact_trace_max_dim``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import lucid
    >>> from lucid.models.generative.neural_ode import (
    ...     NeuralODEConfig, NeuralODEForImageGeneration,
    ... )
    >>> cfg = NeuralODEConfig(sample_size=2, in_channels=1, out_channels=1,
    ...                       hidden_dim=8, num_blocks=1)
    >>> model = NeuralODEForImageGeneration(cfg).eval()
    >>> out = model(lucid.rand((2, 1, 2, 2)))
    >>> out.loss.shape                      # scalar bits/dim
    ()
    >>> model.generate(n_samples=3).samples.shape

        Parameters
        ----------
        n_samples : int, default=1
            Number of samples to draw.
        temperature : float, default=1.0
            Multiplies the prior sample before inversion.  Below ``1`` it
            trades diversity for typicality — a standard trick for flows,
            not part of the paper.
        device : str, optional
            Where to allocate the prior sample.  Default ``"cpu"``.

        Returns
        -------
        GenerationOutput
            ``samples`` of shape ``(n_samples, C, H, W)``.

        Notes
        -----
        Costs one solve, not one per step: the reverse direction carries no
        density term, so it is the cheaper of the two passes.
