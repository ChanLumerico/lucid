"""Lambda-returns over an imagined trajectory.

Shared because both Dreamer families compute the same quantity — the
paper's TD(:math:`\\lambda`) target — and the second one arrived wanting a
per-step discount the first did not have.  One implementation, one place
to check the arithmetic against the paper.

def lambda_return(

) -> Tensor:
    r"""TD(:math:`\lambda`) returns over an imagined trajectory.

    Parameters
    ----------
    reward : Tensor
        Predicted reward at each imagined state, ``(N, H + 1)``.
    value : Tensor
        The critic's estimate at the same states, ``(N, H + 1)``.
    discount : float or Tensor
        :math:`\gamma`.  A scalar holds it constant; a ``(N, H + 1)``
        tensor is the *predicted* continuation probability at each state,
        which is how the paper handles episodes that can terminate — a
        state the agent will not survive discounts everything after it to
        nothing.
    lambda_ : float
        :math:`\lambda`; ``0`` gives the one-step TD target, ``1`` the full
        Monte-Carlo return bootstrapped at the horizon.

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor
        Targets ``(N, H)``, one per state except the last, which is only
        ever used as the bootstrap.

    Notes
    -----
    Computed by the backward recursion the released implementation uses,

    .. math::

        V_\lambda(s_t) = r_t + \gamma\big[(1 - \lambda)\, v(s_{t+1})
                          + \lambda\, V_\lambda(s_{t+1})\big],

    terminated at :math:`V_\lambda(s_H) = v(s_H)`.  Written this way it
    costs one pass rather than the :math:`O(H^2)` the closed form suggests,
    and each :math:`\lambda` power appears exactly once.
