"""The policy head the world models share.

Every Dreamer after the first proposes actions the same way: a dense
trunk over the latent, read as a truncated Gaussian when the action is a
box and as a one-hot categorical when it is a button.  DreamerV2 needed
it first, DreamerV3 needs the same two branches, so it lives here rather
than in either family.

The only thing the two families disagree about is ``unimix``, and it is a
constructor argument.

class Actor(nn.Module):
    r"""A truncated Gaussian, or a one-hot categorical, over actions.

    Dreamer squashed a normal with ``tanh``; this truncates one to
    ``[-1, 1]`` instead.  The reason is the entropy bonus these families
    add: a squashed normal has no closed-form entropy and has to be
    estimated by sampling, while a truncated one is exact.

    Parameters
    ----------
    latent_size, hidden, layers : int
        Shape of the dense trunk.
    action_dim : int
        Width of the action, or the number of alternatives when discrete.
    act_fn : str
        Activation in the trunk.
    min_std : float
        Floor on the scale.
    discrete : bool, default=False
        Whether an action is a choice rather than a vector.
    unimix : float, default=0.0
        Uniform mass mixed into a discrete policy.  Ignored when the
        action space is continuous, which is why it is not an error to
        set both.

    Notes
    -----
    Both continuous parameterisations follow the released implementation:
    ``mean = tanh(raw)``, which lands inside the interval without
    saturating the truncation, and
    ``std = 2 * sigmoid(raw / 2) + min_std``, which is bounded above as
    well as below — an unbounded ``softplus`` would let the policy widen
    until it is uniform and the entropy bonus stops pushing.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import lucid
    >>> from lucid.models.generative._common._actor import Actor
    >>> actor = Actor(8, 16, 2, 3, "silu", 0.1)
