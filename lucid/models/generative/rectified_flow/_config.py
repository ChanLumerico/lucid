"""Rectified Flow configuration — Liu, Gong & Liu, 2023.

The fourth and last step of the flow lineage.  NICE and RealNVP compose
hand-designed bijections; Neural ODE replaces them with one vector field
and pays for a solve on every gradient step; Flow Matching removes the
solve by regressing onto a closed-form target.  All three still integrate
a curved trajectory at sampling time.

Rectified Flow asks what it would take for that trajectory to be
*straight*, and answers with a procedure — **reflow** — that can be
applied repeatedly to an already-trained model.  A straight path is one an
Euler step follows exactly, so the payoff is measured in function
evaluations: not fewer than a hundred, but one.

    Given any coupling of two distributions — in the generative case
    :math:`X_0 \sim \pi_0` noise and :math:`X_1 \sim \pi_1` data, drawn
    independently — the **rectified flow** induced by that pair is the ODE

    .. math::

        \mathrm{d}Z_t = v(Z_t, t)\,\mathrm{d}t, \qquad Z_0 \sim \pi_0,

    whose field is fitted along the straight line between the endpoints,

    .. math::

        \min_v \int_0^1 \mathbb{E}\Bigl[
            \bigl\| (X_1 - X_0) - v(X_t, t) \bigr\|^2
        \Bigr]\,\mathrm{d}t,
        \qquad X_t = t X_1 + (1 - t) X_0 .

    This is the paper's eq. (1), and its minimiser is the conditional
    expectation :math:`v^X(x, t) = \mathbb{E}[X_1 - X_0 \mid X_t = x]`.

    **Relation to what came before.**  The objective is exactly Flow
    Matching's optimal-transport path at :math:`\sigma_{\min} = 0`: the
    interpolation is the same, and the regression target
    :math:`X_1 - X_0` is the same and equally independent of :math:`t`.
    What Rectified Flow adds is not a different loss but what is done
    *with* the trained model.

    **Marginal preservation (Theorem 3.3).**  The solve is not merely a
    sampler that happens to work — :math:`\mathrm{Law}(Z_t) =
    \mathrm{Law}(X_t)` at every :math:`t`, so :math:`Z_1` is distributed
    as the data while :math:`(Z_0, Z_1)` is a *different*, non-independent
    coupling of the same two marginals.  That is what makes the next step
    legitimate.

    **Reflow.**  Because the endpoints of the solve are themselves a valid
    coupling, the whole procedure can be applied to its own output:

    .. math::

        \mathbf{Z}^{k+1} = \mathtt{RectFlow}\bigl((Z_0^k, Z_1^k)\bigr),
        \qquad (Z_0^0, Z_1^0) = (X_0, X_1).

    Each round trains on the *previous* model's (noise, sample) pairs
    instead of independent draws.  The marginals never move — every
    :math:`\mathbf{Z}^k` generates the same data distribution — but the
    transport cost never increases and the paths get straighter.

    **Straightness** is what improves, and it is measurable:

    .. math::

        S(\mathbf{Z}) = \int_0^1 \mathbb{E}\Bigl[
            \bigl\| (Z_1 - Z_0) - \dot{Z}_t \bigr\|^2
        \Bigr]\,\mathrm{d}t ,

    zero exactly when every trajectory is a straight line traversed at
    constant speed.  A straight flow is one the forward Euler method
    integrates **without discretisation error**, so :math:`S \to 0` is
    precisely the statement that one step suffices — which is why the
    paper reports a state-of-the-art one-step FID of 4.85 on CIFAR-10.

    **Distillation** is the same loss with :math:`t` pinned rather than
    drawn: regressing :math:`v(\cdot, 0)` onto :math:`Z_1 - Z_0` over the
    reflow pairs makes :math:`z_0 + v(z_0, 0)` a direct one-step map.
    Reflow is what makes that regression easy — it is fitting an already
    nearly-straight path, not shortcutting a curved one.

    Time runs from noise to data: :math:`t = 0` is :math:`\pi_0` and
    :math:`t = 1` is :math:`\pi_1`.

class RectifiedFlowConfig(GenerativeModelConfig):
    r"""Frozen configuration for every Rectified Flow variant.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample_size : int or tuple of int, default=32
        Spatial resolution of a sample.
    in_channels : int, default=3
        Channels per sample.
    out_channels : int, default=3
        Kept equal to ``in_channels``: the field is a velocity in the
        sample's own space, so it cannot change the dimension.
    act_fn : {"silu", "swish", "relu", "gelu"}, default="silu"
        Activation inside the velocity field.  The reference
        implementation calls this ``swish``, which is the same function.
    base_channels : int, default=128
        Width of the first stage — the reference configs' ``nf``.
    channel_mult : tuple of int, default=(1, 2, 2, 2)
        Per-stage width multipliers; the length sets the ladder depth.
    num_res_blocks : int, default=4
        Residual blocks per resolution.  Four, not two, on CIFAR-10.
    attention_resolutions : tuple of int, default=(16,)
        Spatial sizes at which self-attention is applied — one resolution
        only, unlike the multi-resolution attention of the U-Net Flow
        Matching borrows.
    dropout : float, default=0.15
        Dropout inside residual blocks.
    resnet_groups : int, default=32
        Upper bound on GroupNorm groups; the actual count is
        ``min(channels // 4, resnet_groups)``, as in the reference.
    fir : bool, default=False
        Whether resampling goes through a finite-impulse-response filter
        rather than nearest-neighbour / average pooling.  Off at
        ``32 x 32``, on at ``256 x 256``.
    fir_kernel : tuple of int, default=(1, 3, 3, 1)
        Separable filter taps, normalised to unit sum at build time.
    progressive : {"none", "output_skip"}, default="none"
        Whether the output is accumulated through a resolution pyramid.
    progressive_input : {"none", "input_skip"}, default="none"
        Whether a downsampled copy of the input is injected at each stage.
    embedding_type : {"positional", "fourier"}, default="positional"
        Where the time embedding's frequencies come from.
    fourier_scale : float, default=16.0
        Standard deviation of the random frequencies when
        ``embedding_type="fourier"``.  Ignored otherwise.
    skip_rescale : bool, default=True
        Divide residual and attention sums by :math:`\sqrt{2}`, keeping
        the activation variance from growing with depth.
    init_scale : float, default=0.0
        Gain applied to the last convolution of each block.  Zero makes
        every residual branch start as the identity, which is what the
        reference configs set.
    scale_by_sigma : bool, default=False
        Divide the network output by the conditioning value ``t * 999``.
        All four released 256x256 configs set this; the CIFAR-10 one does
        not, hence the default.  It is part of the trained function, so a
        checkpoint and its flag have to agree.
    t_schedule : {"uniform", "t0", "t1"} or int, default="uniform"
        Which times the objective draws.  ``"uniform"`` is the
        rectified-flow / reflow objective; the others pin ``t`` and turn
        the same loss into k-step distillation.
    time_eps : float, default=1e-3
        Lower end of the time interval.  Times are drawn from
        ``[time_eps, 1]`` and solves run over the same range, matching the
        reference implementation.
    solver : str, default="dopri5"
        Method handed to :func:`lucid.diffeq.odeint`.  ``dopri5`` is the
        embedded Runge–Kutta 4(5) pair the reference calls ``rk45``.
    rtol, atol : float, default=1e-5, 1e-5
        Solver tolerances — the reference's ``ode_tol``.
    trace_method : {"exact", "hutchinson"} or None, default=None
        How the divergence is obtained when scoring likelihood.  ``None``
        picks by dimension.  Irrelevant to training.
    trace_noise : {"rademacher", "gaussian"}, default="rademacher"
        Probe distribution for the Hutchinson estimate.
    exact_trace_max_dim : int, default=32
        Dimension below which ``trace_method=None`` resolves to
        ``"exact"``.

    Notes
    -----
    ``in_channels`` and ``out_channels`` must agree: the field lives in
    the sample's own space.
