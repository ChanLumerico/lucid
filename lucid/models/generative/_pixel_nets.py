"""Pixel encoder / decoder and dense head — shared by the world models.

PlaNet cites "the convolutional and deconvolutional networks from Ha &
Schmidhuber, 2018" for its observation model, and Dreamer says it uses the
same ones.  Two families, one stack, so it lives here beside ``_rssm.py``
rather than being copied into each.

Geometry, at 64x64 with no padding anywhere::

    encode:  64 -> 31 -> 14 -> 6 -> 2      four 4x4 convolutions, stride 2
             channels d, 2d, 4d, 8d        flatten to 8d * 2 * 2 = 32d

    decode:  1 -> 5 -> 13 -> 30 -> 64      kernels 5, 5, 6, 6, stride 2
             channels 4d, 2d, d, out

Both chains land on their targets exactly, which is why the kernel
schedule is irregular and why 64 is the only resolution these express.

Like :class:`RSSM`, these take plain integers rather than a config — the
families that share them have different config classes, and a shared
building block should not know which one it is being built from.
