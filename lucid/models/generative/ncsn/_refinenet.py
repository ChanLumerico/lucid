"""RefineNet score network — the backbone NCSN v1/v2 actually specify.

Song & Ermon's Implementation Details name a 4-cascade RefineNet with
**CondInstanceNorm++** (v1) or **InstanceNorm++** (v2), **ELU** throughout,
and **dilated convolutions replacing subsampling** in the deeper cascades.
That is a different inductive bias from the DDPM U-Net the family reuses by
default — GroupNorm, SiLU, self-attention and a sinusoidal timestep
embedding, which is what NCSN++ later moved to.

The distinguishing piece is the normalisation.  InstanceNorm++ adds a term
the plain version drops: it normalises each channel spatially *and* rescales
by the per-sample mean of those channel means, so the network keeps
information about overall image brightness that instance norm would
otherwise throw away.  §3.3 of the v1 paper introduces it for exactly that
reason.  The conditional form keeps one gain/bias triple per noise level.

    r"""Conditional InstanceNorm++ (Song & Ermon 2019, §3.3).

    For input :math:`x` with per-channel spatial statistics
    :math:`\mu_k, s_k`, and :math:`m, v` the mean and standard deviation of
    :math:`\mu` across channels:

    .. math::

        z_k = \gamma_{i,k}\,\frac{x_k - \mu_k}{s_k}
            + \beta_{i,k}
            + \alpha_{i,k}\,\frac{\mu_k - m}{v}

    The third term is the "++".  Plain instance norm removes the per-channel
    mean and with it any notion of which channels were brighter than the
    others; the extra branch feeds that back, and the paper reports colour
    shifts in generated samples without it.  Each :math:`i` indexes a noise
    level, so the gains are conditional.
