    RealNVP takes the coupling layer of NICE and makes it *scale* as well
    as shift, which is what finally let exact-likelihood flows model
    natural images.  An **affine coupling layer** splits the input with a
    binary mask :math:`b` and rescales the unmasked half by a learned,
    input-dependent factor:

    .. math::

        y = b \odot x + (1 - b) \odot
            \Big(x \odot \exp\big(s(b \odot x)\big) + t(b \odot x)\Big).

    The Jacobian is still triangular, so its log-determinant is just
    :math:`\sum (1 - b) \odot s` — no matter how deep :math:`s` and
    :math:`t` are.  Unlike NICE's additive coupling this map is no longer
    volume-preserving, so the flow can concentrate and dilate density
    where the data needs it rather than relying on one global diagonal
    scaling.

    Two masks exploit image structure.  The **checkerboard** mask is 1
    where the sum of the spatial coordinates is odd; the **channel-wise**
    mask is 1 on the first half of the channels.  Between the two, a
    **squeeze** trades space for depth — each :math:`2 \times 2 \times c`
    block becomes :math:`1 \times 1 \times 4c`, turning an
    :math:`s \times s \times c` tensor into
    :math:`\tfrac{s}{2} \times \tfrac{s}{2} \times 4c` — so that
    channel-wise masking after the squeeze partitions along a different
    axis than the checkerboard did before it.

    The third idea is the **multi-scale architecture**.  Each scale runs
    three alternating checkerboard couplings, squeezes, runs three
    alternating channel-wise couplings, then *factors out* half the
    dimensions:

    .. math::

        h^{(0)} = x, \qquad
        \big(z^{(i+1)}, h^{(i+1)}\big) = f^{(i+1)}\big(h^{(i)}\big),
        \qquad z = \big(z^{(1)}, \dots, z^{(L)}\big).

    Factored-out dimensions are modelled as Gaussians immediately and
    stop paying compute, so the network spends its depth on the
    coarse-scale structure that still needs it; the final scale applies
    four alternating checkerboard couplings and emits the rest.
    Coupling networks are residual convolutional stacks (ReLU, skip
    connections) whose :math:`s` output is a :math:`\tanh` scaled by a
    learned factor — bounded, so the exponential cannot explode early in
    training.

    Because pixel data is bounded and quantised, the model is fitted in
    logit space: :math:`x \mapsto \mathrm{logit}\big(\alpha + (1 - 2
    \alpha) x\big)` with :math:`\alpha = 0.05`, whose log-determinant is
    part of the reported likelihood.  RealNVP reaches 3.49 bits/dim on
    CIFAR-10 with exact inference *and* exact single-pass sampling —
    neither of which a VAE or an autoregressive model gives you — and its
    coupling/multi-scale recipe is inherited almost unchanged by Glow.

    """Configuration for every RealNVP variant.

    Defaults reproduce the paper's Imagenet ``32 x 32`` setup (§4.1):
    four scales, four residual blocks per coupling network, 32 feature
    maps at the first scale, and a standard normal prior.

    Args:
        num_scales: Levels of the multi-scale recursion ``L``.  Every
            level except the last squeezes once and factors out half of
            its dimensions, so the spatial size halves ``L - 1`` times.
            The paper recurses "until the input of the last recursion is
            ``4 x 4 x c``" — four scales for a ``32 x 32`` input — and
            uses a single downscale for CIFAR-10.
        residual_blocks: Residual blocks inside each coupling network.
            Paper §4.1: ``4`` at ``32 x 32``, ``2`` at ``64 x 64``, ``8``
            for CIFAR-10.
        base_dim: Feature maps in the first scale's coupling networks;
            doubled at every subsequent scale, as in the released
            implementation.  Paper §4.1: ``32``, or ``64`` for CIFAR-10.
        use_weight_norm: Apply weight normalisation to every convolution
            inside the coupling networks (paper §4.1).
        use_batch_norm: Enable batch normalisation — inside the coupling
            networks *and* on each coupling layer's output, where it is
            an invertible rescaling that contributes to the
            log-determinant (paper §3.7).  Inversion uses the running
            statistics, so ``decode`` is exact in ``eval()`` mode.
        data_constraint: Width of the logit squash applied before the
            flow, matching the released implementation's
            ``data_constraint``: ``x`` in ``[0, 1]`` is mapped into
            ``[(1 - c) / 2, (1 + c) / 2]`` before the logit, i.e.
            ``alpha = 0.05`` at the default ``0.9``.

    Notes:
        ``out_channels`` must equal ``in_channels`` — a flow is a
        bijection on its sample space.  ``sample_size`` must be divisible
        by ``2 ** (num_scales - 1)`` so every squeeze has an even spatial
        extent to work on.
