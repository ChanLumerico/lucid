"""Registry factories for Stable Diffusion.

One architecture, not five.  The released v1 line — 1.1 through 1.5 —
is one network trained for different numbers of steps on different
subsets; the configs are identical, so the versions are *weight tags*
rather than variants and registering five factories would invent
architecture where there is none.

**v2 is deliberately absent.**  It does differ — OpenCLIP ViT-H
conditions it at 1024 rather than 768 — but its published configuration
could not be read from the primary source when this was written, and
the field that decides its attention shape is named for the opposite of
what it means (see ``attention_head_dim`` in the config).  A variant
whose numbers cannot be cited is exactly what H11 forbids, so it waits
for the config rather than shipping a guess.

No parameter counts are registered.  The paper quotes 1.45B for its own
text-to-image LDM, which is a different model from the released ones —
quoting it here would attribute the paper's figure to Stability's
network.  ``summary="auto"`` reports what is actually built.

The weights are converted by
:mod:`tools.convert_weights.stable_diffusion` and were verified against
the reference activation by activation, not merely loaded — see
:mod:`._weights` for the numbers and for the one residual that is the
CPU kernel's rather than the conversion's.

    ``cross_attention_dim`` is 768, which is exactly
    :func:`~lucid.models.clip_vit_large_14`'s text width — that tower is
    what produced the conditioning these settings were trained against.

    That call materialises 943M parameters — about three gigabytes — and
    what it will build is a property of the configuration, so the shape
    is read there instead:

        Load the released v1 checkpoint into the sampler.  This is the

        the weights — it loads the same entry
        :func:`stable_diffusion` does, into the model held inside.
