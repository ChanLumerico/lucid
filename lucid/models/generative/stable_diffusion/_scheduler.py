r"""The samplers — DDIM and PNDM — over the released noise schedule.

**Which one the release actually uses.**  The published
``scheduler_config.json`` names ``PNDMScheduler``, and ``model_index.json``
wires it into the pipeline; ``skip_prk_steps`` in that file is a PNDM
field and nothing else reads it.  The LDM paper, on the other hand,
samples with DDIM and reports its FID under it.

Both are here for that reason.  :class:`DDIMScheduler` is the paper's
and the simpler contract — one parameter :math:`\eta` spanning DDPM at
1 and deterministic DDIM at 0.  :class:`PNDMScheduler` is the release's
default and is what reproduces its images.  They share the schedule,
the :math:`\bar\alpha` table and the epsilon prediction; only the step
rule differs, which is why PNDM is written on top of DDIM rather than
beside it.

DDPM's ancestral sampler needs one network evaluation per training
timestep, so a thousand-step model costs a thousand forwards. DDIM
(Song et al., ICLR 2021) reinterprets the same trained network as
defining a *non-Markovian* process whose reverse can skip: the update

.. math::

    z_{t-1} = \sqrt{\bar\alpha_{t-1}}\,
        \underbrace{\frac{z_t - \sqrt{1-\bar\alpha_t}\,
        \epsilon_\theta}{\sqrt{\bar\alpha_t}}}_{\hat z_0}
        + \sqrt{1 - \bar\alpha_{t-1} - \sigma_t^2}\; \epsilon_\theta
        + \sigma_t \epsilon

is valid for any decreasing subsequence of timesteps, and at
:math:`\eta = 0` the :math:`\sigma_t \epsilon` term vanishes and the
whole trajectory becomes deterministic. That is what makes fifty steps
enough, and what makes the same seed reproduce the same image.

**``scaled_linear`` is not linear.** The released schedule interpolates
linearly in :math:`\sqrt{\beta}` and squares the result:

.. math::

    \beta_t = \Big((1 - \tfrac{t}{T})\sqrt{\beta_0}
        + \tfrac{t}{T}\sqrt{\beta_T}\Big)^2 .

Using a plain linear ramp between the same endpoints gives a schedule
that looks nearly identical plotted, differs most where the signal is
still strong, and denoises to mush. It has its own name here for that
reason, and a test pins the two apart.

    r"""The release's default sampler — linear multistep over DDIM's step.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : StableDiffusionConfig
        Read for the same fields :class:`DDIMScheduler` uses.

    Notes
    -----
    Reference: Liu et al., *"Pseudo Numerical Methods for Diffusion
    Models on Manifolds"*, ICLR, 2022 (`arXiv:2202.09778
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09778>`_); the constants are the released
    Stable Diffusion configuration, whose ``_class_name`` is this.

    The update is DDIM's at :math:`\eta = 0` applied not to the current
    epsilon but to an Adams-Bashforth combination of the last four:

    .. math::

        \bar\epsilon_t = \tfrac{1}{24}\big(55\epsilon_t - 59\epsilon_{t-1}
            + 37\epsilon_{t-2} - 9\epsilon_{t-3}\big),

    with lower-order openers while the history fills — the plain
    prediction first, then a trapezoid, then a two-term rule, then a
    three-term one.  Four evaluations of information per step is what
    buys the same image in fifty steps that DDIM needs more of.

    **It carries state**, unlike :class:`DDIMScheduler`.  The history,
    the step counter and the sample the opener began from live on the
    object, so one instance cannot sample two trajectories at once.
    Sequential reuse is safe: :meth:`timesteps` means "start a sample"
    and clears the history, and :meth:`step` checks that the timestep it
    is handed is the one at the counter's position.  That check is the
    one that matters — the order of the correction is chosen by position,
    so stepping out of order applies the wrong rule to right-looking
    numbers.  :meth:`reset` is there for the caller who wants to say so
    without asking for a trajectory.

    The second step repeats the first timestep rather than advancing —
    ``counter == 1`` in the reference — which looks like an off-by-one
    and is the trapezoidal opener needing both endpoints.

        The repeat is the trapezoidal opener, and the reference puts it
        in the list rather than in the step.  Its slices —
        ``[t[:-1], t[-2:-1], t[-1:]]`` — are taken on the *ascending*
        array before reversal, so the duplicated entry lands **second**
        in the descending order: 901, 801, 801, 701, and not
        …, 101, 101, 1.  Reading those slices as descending puts the
