"""GPT-2 configuration (Radford et al., 2019).

Paper: "Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners".  Key
differences from GPT-1 captured in the model file (pre-LN layout, final
``ln_f``, larger BPE vocab, longer context).  This config only stores the
knobs — see :mod:`lucid.models.text.gpt2._model` for the architectural
choices that follow from them.

    GPT-2 retains GPT-1's decoder-only causal-LM objective

    .. math::

        \mathcal{L}_{\text{LM}}(\theta)
            = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \log p_\theta(x_t \mid x_{<t}),

    but introduces three architectural refinements that have since
    become standard for autoregressive transformers.  **Pre-LayerNorm**
    moves the LayerNorm to the input of every sub-block (attention and
    MLP), so each block computes :math:`h \leftarrow h + f(\mathrm{LN}(h))`
    instead of :math:`h \leftarrow \mathrm{LN}(h + f(h))`; combined with
    a **final LayerNorm** (``ln_f``) after the last block, this yields
    much more stable optimisation at depth.  Residual projection weights
    are initialised with an extra :math:`1/\sqrt{2N}` factor (where
    :math:`N` is the layer count), which keeps activation variance
    roughly invariant to depth.

    The tokenizer switches to a byte-level BPE with a 50257-symbol
    vocabulary (50256 merges plus the ``<|endoftext|>`` sentinel), and
    context length doubles from 512 to 1024.  The released family spans
    four sizes — *small* (124M, the defaults above), *medium* (355M),
    *large* (774M), and *xl* (1.5B) — by scaling
    :math:`(\text{hidden\_size}, \text{num\_hidden\_layers},
    \text{num\_attention\_heads})` while holding ``intermediate_size =
    4 \cdot \text{hidden\_size}`` and head-dim = 64 fixed.

    The paper's headline finding is that a sufficiently large LM trained
    on WebText (~40 GB scraped from outbound Reddit links) performs
    competitive **zero-shot** transfer across reading comprehension,
    translation, summarisation, and QA — without any task-specific
    fine-tuning.  This is the empirical seed of in-context learning and
    the modern prompting paradigm.
