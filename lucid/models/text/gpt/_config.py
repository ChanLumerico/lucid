"""GPT-1 configuration (Radford et al., 2018).

Paper: "Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training".  Single
canonical size in the original paper (L=12, H=768, A=12, T=512); we expose a
``GPTConfig`` parametrised the same way as ``BertConfig`` so downstream code
can build smaller variants for tests / quick experiments without monkey-
patching.

Differences from BERT:
    - decoder-only (causal mask applied inside attention)
    - no segment embedding (``type_vocab_size`` is unused)
    - default activation is ``gelu_new`` (Hendrycks tanh approximation, per the
      GPT-1 reference code)
    - tied input/output embeddings by default

    GPT — *Generative Pre-Training* — is a decoder-only transformer trained
    on an autoregressive (causal) language-modelling objective.  Given a
    token sequence :math:`x = (x_1, \dots, x_T)`, the network factorises
    the joint distribution left-to-right and maximises

    .. math::

        \mathcal{L}_{\text{LM}}(\theta)
            = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \log p_\theta(x_t \mid x_{<t}),

    where :math:`p_\theta(x_t \mid x_{<t}) =
    \operatorname{softmax}(W_e h_t^{(L)})` and :math:`h_t^{(L)}` is the
    final-layer hidden state at position :math:`t`.  Causality is enforced
    by an upper-triangular mask inside scaled dot-product attention, so
    position :math:`t` only attends to :math:`\{1, \dots, t\}`.

    The architecture is a stack of :math:`L=12` transformer blocks
    (``hidden_size=768``, 12 heads, ``intermediate_size=3072``) with
    learned absolute position embeddings and the tanh-approximated GELU
    activation (``gelu_new``).  Input and output token embeddings are
    tied — the LM head reuses :math:`W_e^\top` — which halves the
    parameter count of the softmax layer.  Unlike BERT, there is no
    segment embedding and no masked-LM objective; downstream tasks are
    handled by appending a task-specific delimiter sequence and reading
    off the final hidden state.

    Empirically, GPT established that **unsupervised pre-training on a
    large unlabeled corpus** (BookCorpus, ~800M tokens) followed by
    supervised fine-tuning transfers across a wide range of NLP tasks,
    foreshadowing the scaling-law regime later formalised by Kaplan et
    al. (2020).  Increasing depth, width, and corpus size yields smooth,
    power-law improvements in held-out perplexity — the foundation that
    GPT-2 and GPT-3 scale up.
