    Parameters
    ----------
    embed_dim : int, default=512
        Width of the space every modality is projected into.  This is
        the dimension a downstream consumer sees, and it is deliberately
        separate from either tower's own width — the towers are free to
        differ from each other and from the space they meet in.
    act_fn : MultimodalActivation, default="quick_gelu"
        Activation inside the towers.

    Notes
    -----
    The field this base carries is the one that makes a model
    *multimodal* in the structural sense this zoo classifies by: two or
    more encoders that are trained to land in one representation.  A
    model that merely consumes two inputs without a shared space — a
    conditioned generator, say — belongs to the domain of whatever it
    generates, not here.

    Deliberately **not** carried: the contrastive temperature.  It is
    universal to contrastive families and meaningless to the rest, so it
    belongs to a tier below this one.  That tier is not created while
    :class:`~lucid.models.multimodal.clip.CLIPConfig` is its only
    member — the zoo's rule is that a shared base needs consumers before
    it is written, and the sibling domains' tiers (``DiffusionModelConfig``,
    ``NormalizingFlowConfig``) each had two or three when they appeared.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from lucid.models.multimodal import MultimodalModelConfig
    >>> MultimodalModelConfig.model_type
    'multimodal'
