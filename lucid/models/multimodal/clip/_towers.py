"""Transformer building blocks shared by multimodal towers.

A two-tower model runs the same block over two modalities, and the only
thing that differs between the towers is whether the sequence has an
order to respect — text does, patches do not.  So the block is written
once here and parameterised by that, rather than twice in a family and
kept in step by hand.

These live in the family rather than one level up because CLIP is their
only consumer.  The domain layer holds what several families share; a
block with one user belongs to that user, and moves up when a second
appears — SigLIP and ALIGN would both want exactly this block.

They are not in :mod:`lucid.nn` for a different reason: they encode a
pre-norm-with-``QuickGELU`` shape because that is what the released
contrastive checkpoints were trained in.
:class:`lucid.nn.TransformerEncoderLayer` is the same idea with the
framework's own defaults, and it will not load these weights.

    Notes
    -----
    Not the same function as :func:`lucid.nn.functional.gelu`.  It is a
    sigmoid approximation of it from a time when the exact form was
    expensive, and it survives because the published checkpoints were
    trained with it: the upstream configurations name it outright
    (``hidden_act: "quick_gelu"``).  Swapping in exact GELU shifts every
    activation slightly, which no shape test can see and which shows up
    as a quietly degraded score.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import lucid
    >>> from lucid.models.multimodal import QuickGELU

    Parameters
    ----------
    width : int
        Residual stream width.
    heads : int
        Attention heads.  ``width`` must divide by it.
    causal : bool, default=False
        Mask future positions.  True for a text tower, false for an
        image one — patches have no order to respect, and masking them
        would hide half of every image from the class token.

    Attributes
    ----------
    ln_1, ln_2 : lucid.nn.LayerNorm
        Applied *before* attention and the MLP respectively.
    attn : lucid.nn.MultiheadAttention
        Self-attention with fused Q/K/V.
    mlp : lucid.nn.Sequential
        ``Linear → QuickGELU → Linear`` at four times the width.

    -----
    Pre-norm rather than post-norm: the residual path stays unnormalised
    end to end, which is what lets these depths train without a warmup
    schedule tuned per variant.
