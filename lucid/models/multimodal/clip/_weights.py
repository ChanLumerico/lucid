"""Pretrained-weight declarations for CLIP.

The four ViT releases OpenAI published, converted by
:mod:`tools.convert_weights.clip` from the ``transformers``-layout
re-hosting of the original checkpoints.  These are the authors' own
trained parameters — no reimplementation was trained to produce them.

Each was checked numerically against the reference before publication,
not merely loaded: with the converted weights in place, Lucid's
``logits_per_image`` agrees with the reference to a relative error
between 3.8e-07 and 1.5e-06, which is float32 round-off.  That check is
the one that matters here, because the conversion transposes two
projection matrices and fuses three attention matrices into one — and
the transpose of ``text_projection`` is *square* in the base models, so
getting it backwards would have produced a model of exactly the right
shape that silently ranks nothing.

Preprocessing is CLIPModel's own, and is not ImageNet's: bicubic resize to
the tower's resolution, centre crop, and the dataset statistics below,
which come from the released preprocessor configuration rather than
from the paper.

One measured detail, because it looks like a discrepancy and is not.
Every released checkpoint stores ``logit_scale = 4.605170``, whose
exponential is 100.000006 — the trained temperature sat *at* the
paper's ceiling, which is what "clipped to prevent scaling the logits
by more than 100" produces when the constraint binds. Lucid applies
that cap in :attr:`CLIPModel.scale`, so it returns exactly 100.0 where the
reference — which clamps in its training loop rather than its model —
returns 100.000006. The resulting relative difference is 6e-08, three
orders below the float32 agreement reported above, and the cap is doing
what the paper describes rather than distorting the checkpoint.

No accuracy metrics are recorded.  The paper reports zero-shot numbers
against prompt ensembles it does not fully enumerate, so a single
figure here would be attributing a score to a protocol this repository
has not reproduced.
