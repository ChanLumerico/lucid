"""CLIP tokenizer — byte-level BPE with an end-of-word marker.

CLIP's scheme is a hybrid of the two already in the tree, which is why
it is neither of them.  It is **byte-level** like GPT-2's, so any input
round-trips without an unknown token; and it seeds each word as
``list(w[:-1]) + [w[-1] + "</w>"]`` like GPT-1's, so the merge table can
tell ``"in"`` inside a word from ``"in"`` ending one.  GPT-2 marks the
boundary with a leading ``Ġ`` instead, and the two markers produce
incompatible merge tables — a vocabulary built for one cannot be read by
the other.

The vocabulary's size follows from that construction, and settles a
discrepancy worth writing down.  The paper says "49,152 vocab size"; the
released models have 49408 rows.  Both are correct about different
things:

.. code-block:: text

    256    byte symbols
  + 256    byte symbols suffixed with </w>
  + 48894  merges
  + 2      <|startoftext|>, <|endoftext|>
  ------
    49408

and 49152 is the target the merge list is *sliced* to
(``merges[1:49152-256-2+1]``) before the byte symbols are counted.

**Where this differs from ``transformers``, measured.**  On five
varied captions the ids agree with ``transformers``' CLIP tokenizer on
four.  The fifth is ``"&amp;amp;"``: this implementation unescapes HTML
entities twice and yields ``&``, matching the reference implementation
the paper shipped —

.. code-block:: python

    text = ftfy.fix_text(text)
    text = html.unescape(html.unescape(text))

— while ``transformers`` tokenises the entity literally.  Doubly-escaped
entities are common in scraped captions, which is why the released code
unescapes twice, so the divergence is resolved in favour of the authors'
own tokenizer rather than the re-hosting's.

**One preprocessing step is deliberately absent.**  The reference calls
``ftfy.fix_text`` to repair mojibake before anything else.  Lucid's
compute and utility paths take no third-party dependency, so it is not
called here.  For text that is already valid UTF-8 — which is what a
caller passing Python ``str`` has — the step is the identity, so the
difference is confined to inputs that were already corrupt.  It is
recorded rather than hidden because it means this tokenizer is not
bit-identical to the reference on adversarial input.

    :meth:`tokenize` is the method the model wants: it frames each
    caption with the two sentinels and pads to a fixed width, which is
    what makes ``argmax`` over the ids find ``[EOS]``.  :meth:`encode`
    is inherited and does neither — it returns the bare BPE ids, which
    is what a caller building their own framing wants.

        Notes

        Padding is ``0``, which is a real token id in a CLIP vocabulary.

    Notes
    -----
    **How this is possible at all.**  The engine's BPE seeds one symbol
    per codepoint, so handing it ``"hello</w>"`` tears the marker into
    ``<``, ``/``, ``w``, ``>`` — four symbols where the scheme needs the
    marker fused to the final character.  That was measured, and it is
    why :class:`~lucid.models.text.gpt.GPTTokenizerFast` carries no
    acceleration at all.

    The way through is a *vocabulary* rewrite rather than an engine one.
    Every entry ending in ``</w>`` is folded so the marker and the
    character before it become a single private-use codepoint, and the
    same fold is applied to the merge table and to each chunk before it
    is handed over.  The engine then seeds exactly the symbols the scheme
    intends, applies the merges it was given, and returns ids from the
    unmodified id space — the fold changes only the *keys*, never the
    values, so nothing downstream sees it.

    The same trick would give GPT-1 a genuine fast path; that class's
    note that the scheme "needs an engine change" is one option, not the
    only one.
