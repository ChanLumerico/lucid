"""Shared loss primitives for mask-classification segmentation heads.

MaskFormer and Mask2Former both frame segmentation as *mask classification*:
:math:`N` queries each predict a class and a binary mask, and training needs a
bipartite matching between those queries and the ground-truth segments plus a
per-pair mask objective.  The pieces below are the parts both families share.

The two differ in one respect that matters here — MaskFormer's mask cost is a
**focal** term, Mask2Former's is plain **sigmoid cross-entropy** — so the
pairwise helpers come in both flavours rather than one being made to stand in
for the other.
