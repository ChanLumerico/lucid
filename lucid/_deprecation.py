"""Retiring a public name without breaking the code that calls it.

Lucid follows Semantic Versioning.  Within a major version nothing public
disappears, and nothing public changes how it is called, without warning
first: a name on its way out keeps working for at least
:data:`MIN_MINOR_RELEASES` minor releases and says so every time it is
used.  3.x broke that promise several times — ``mobilenet_v1`` became
``mobilenet``, ``GenerationMixin`` became ``CausalLMMixin`` and 43 names
left ``lucid.models``, each in a minor release — and code written a month
earlier stopped importing.

:func:`deprecated` marks a function or class.  The released-surface test
(``lucid/test/unit/audit/test_released_surface.py``) holds the other half:
a name in the last release's surface may leave only once the release it
was marked to leave in has come.

Renaming a function keeps the old name as a deprecated wrapper::

    @deprecated(since="3.16.0", removal="3.18.0", alternative="lucid.models.mobilenet")
    def mobilenet_v1(*args, **kwargs):
        return mobilenet(*args, **kwargs)

Renaming a class keeps the old name as a deprecated subclass, so the new
class itself is left untouched::

    @deprecated(since="3.16.0", removal="3.18.0", alternative="CausalLMMixin")
    class GenerationMixin(CausalLMMixin):
        pass

A name that stays but stops accepting one way of being called — an
argument order, a keyword — cannot be marked as a whole.  The code path
that still accepts the old spelling calls :func:`warn_deprecated` instead,
with the same window and the same message::

    if index_first:
        warn_deprecated(
            "the argument order gather(input, indices, dim)",
            since="3.16.0",
            removal="3.18.0",
            alternative="gather(input, dim, index)",
        )
