"""``lucid.weights`` — pretrained-weight system for the model zoo.

A standalone package (sibling to :mod:`lucid.models`) that provides the
*infrastructure* for pretrained checkpoints: the tagged-variant enum
base, hub download + SHA verification, loading, and a discovery
registry.  Preprocessing lives in :mod:`lucid.utils.transforms`; a
checkpoint's :class:`WeightEntry` carries one of those transforms.

It deliberately contains **no architecture-specific weight
declarations**.  Each model family declares its own checkpoints in a
``_weights.py`` module *inside the model package* (e.g.
``lucid.models.vision.resnet._weights.ResNet18Weights``), importing the
primitives below.  This keeps :mod:`lucid.weights` a pure porting
substrate and the dependency one-directional (``models`` → ``weights``,
never the reverse).

Design
------
Each architecture declares a :class:`WeightsEnum` (e.g.
``ResNet18Weights``) whose members are :class:`WeightEntry` manifests —
one per tagged checkpoint (``IMAGENET1K_V1``, …) plus a ``DEFAULT``
alias.  This mirrors the torchvision ``Weights`` enum so call sites are
familiar::

    import lucid.models as models
    import lucid.weights as weights

    # default tag
    model = models.resnet_18(pretrained=True)

    # explicit tag — enum or string
    from lucid.models.vision.resnet import ResNet18Weights
    model = models.resnet_18_cls(weights=ResNet18Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1)
    model = models.resnet_18_cls(pretrained="IMAGENET1K_V1")

    # discover + preprocess (after the model package is imported)
    weights.list_pretrained("resnet_18")        # ['IMAGENET1K_V1']
    w = weights.get_weight("ResNet18Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1")
    x = w.transforms()(image)

The package depends only on :mod:`lucid.serialization` (for SafeTensors
loading); model factories depend on it, never the reverse, so there is
no circular import.  Crucially, :class:`WeightEntry` carries no model
config — named factories already pin their own.

Checkpoints are hosted on the Hugging Face Hub under the ``lucid-dl``
org, converted from torchvision / timm / transformers sources by the
offline ``tools/convert_weights`` pipeline.
