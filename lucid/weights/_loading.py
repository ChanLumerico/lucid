    Implements the shared selection logic every pretrained factory uses,
    so the three call styles all funnel to one enum member (or ``None``
    for random init).

    Parameters
    ----------
    enum_cls : type[WeightsEnum]
        The architecture's weights enum (e.g. ``ResNet18Weights``).
    pretrained : bool or str
        ``False`` → no weights; ``True`` → the ``DEFAULT`` tag; a string
        → that specific tag (e.g. ``"IMAGENET1K_V1"``).
    weights : WeightsEnum or None
        An explicit enum member.  Takes precedence over ``pretrained``
        when given.

    Returns
    -------
    WeightsEnum or None
        The selected member, or ``None`` for random initialisation.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If ``weights`` is from a different enum than ``enum_cls``, or
        ``pretrained`` is neither bool nor str.
    ValueError
        If a string tag is not a member of ``enum_cls``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : Module
        Destination model.  Its ``state_dict`` keys must match the
        checkpoint's (the SafeTensors file is produced by the
        conversion tool against this exact key layout).
    weights : WeightsEnum or WeightEntry
        The checkpoint to load — either an enum member
        (``ResNet18Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1``) or a bare
        :class:`WeightEntry`.
    name : str, keyword-only
        Cache identifier, conventionally ``"<model>/<tag>"`` so each
        checkpoint caches to its own directory.
    strict : bool, optional, keyword-only, default=True
        Forwarded to :meth:`Module.load_state_dict`.  ``False`` tolerates
        missing / unexpected keys (e.g. when swapping the head).

    Returns
    -------
    object
        The ``_IncompatibleKeys(missing_keys, unexpected_keys)`` result

    Notes
