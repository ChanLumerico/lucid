lucid.compile._entry.module — Phase 1.4 CompiledModule.

Wraps a regular :class:`nn.Module` so that subsequent calls with the
same input signature reuse a single :class:`MPSGraphExecutable` rather
than re-dispatching through eager.  Mirrors the delegation pattern of
:class:`lucid.nn.functional.linear.FusedLinear` — the wrapper is
itself a :class:`nn.Module` and re-exposes the inner model's
parameters / state_dict / training mode, but does NOT register the
inner model under ``_modules`` (that would double-count parameters on
walks).

Phase 1.4 ships **forward-only graph caching**: the cached executable
captures the forward pass only, and the result tensor is returned
without a backward graph (``requires_grad=False``).  Training-step
compile — the autograd-integrated path that runs ``loss.backward()``
against a cached fwd+bwd executable — is the dedicated
:func:`lucid.compile.compiled_step` entrypoint until Phase 1.5 lands
the autograd-integrated :class:`CompiledStepBackward` node.

Acceptance gate (Plan §1.4):

  * 100 calls same signature → 1 compile + 99 cache hits.
  * Shape change → recompile.
  * Unsupported op → eager fallback with correct result + signature
    remembered in :class:`EagerFallbackSet` so we don't re-attempt.

    r"""User-facing wrapper returned by :func:`lucid.compile`.

    Wraps an :class:`nn.Module` (or any callable, via the internal
    :class:`_CallableModule` adapter) so the model's ``__call__`` is
    routed through a per-signature cache of compiled
    :class:`MPSGraphExecutable` objects.  Behaves like the underlying
    model for every non-call attribute (``parameters`` / ``state_dict``
    / ``train`` / ``eval`` / ``to`` / submodule attribute access), so
    optimizers, schedulers and checkpointing pipelines see the
    compiled module as a drop-in replacement.

    Lifecycle
    ---------
    On the first call with a given input signature
    ``(shape × dtype × device × training × param_fingerprint)`` the
    wrapper:

    1. Traces ``model(*args)`` under :func:`no_grad` while the
       :class:`Tracer` records every op into a :class:`TraceGraph`.
    2. Lowers the graph to a single :class:`MPSGraphExecutable` via
       ``compile_or_cached``.
    3. Builds an *input plan* mapping each placeholder in
       ``exe.input_ids`` to either a positional :class:`Tensor` slot
       from the call site or a pinned external feed (parameter /
       constant).
    4. Records a ``return_spec`` so the executable's flat output list
       can be re-packed into the user's original return structure
       (tuple, dataclass, dict, ...).

    On subsequent calls with the same signature step (1)–(3) are
    skipped and the cached executable runs directly.  Cache lookup
    cost is one ``__hash__`` + ``__eq__`` on the :class:`CacheKey`
    plus an integer-slot resolution per feed — typically O(μs).

    Two cache layers cooperate here:

    * **Python-side ``self._cache``** — unbounded ``dict`` keyed by
      :class:`CacheKey`, holds the :class:`_CacheEntry` + return spec
      + timing.  Dropped on :meth:`train` / :meth:`eval` / :meth:`to`
      / :meth:`load_state_dict` / :meth:`clear_cache`.
    * **C++ ``ExecutableCache::session()``** — process-global LRU
      bounded by ``LUCID_COMPILE_MAX_CACHE`` (default 32).  Holds
      one ``CompiledExecutable`` per *trace structure* so two
      :class:`CompiledModule` instances tracing the same op DAG
      share the underlying Metal kernels.  Cache key includes per-op
      attributes (since 2026-05-24), so ``dropout(p=0)`` and
      ``dropout(p=0.5)`` no longer collide.

    Attributes
    ----------
    model : nn.Module
        The wrapped model (read via the ``.model`` property).
    dynamic : bool
        ``True`` if the wrapper was constructed with the symbolic
        batch axis opt-in (Phase 1.6).  Forced to ``False`` until
        the MPSGraph SDK stabilises dynamic-shape lowering.
    training : bool
        Mirrors ``self._model.training``; flipping invalidates the
        cache (BN / Dropout codepaths diverge between modes).

    Notes
    -----
    * **Metal-only.**  Compile is meaningful only when both the model
      and its inputs live on the ``metal`` device.  On CPU every call
      silently routes through eager — the cache stays empty and
      ``eager_only`` grows.
    * **kwargs compile too.**  Keyword-passed tensors are traced like
      positional ones; each executable feed is bound back to either an
      ``args`` index or a ``kwargs`` name at call time (see
      ``_CacheEntry.input_source``).  Non-tensor kwargs are baked into
      the trace structure and captured by the :class:`CacheKey`, so a
      different scalar kwarg re-keys (and recompiles) correctly.
    * **Dropout in training mode falls back per signature.**  See
      :file:`OpEmitters/nn/Dropout.mm` — the emitter returns nullptr
      when ``training=True and p>0`` to preserve dropout's
      step-to-step randomness (the stateless RNG path would apply
      the same mask every call).

    Examples

    Inference path::

        cm = lucid.compile(model.to('metal').eval())
        for batch in loader:
            y = cm(batch.to('metal'))

    Training step compile (forward only — backward stays eager)::

        cm = lucid.compile(model.to('metal'))
        opt = lucid.optim.Adam(cm.parameters(), lr=1e-3)
        for batch, target in loader:
            opt.zero_grad()
            loss = F.cross_entropy(cm(batch), target)
            loss.backward()
            opt.step()

    Fully fused (forward + backward + update in one executable)::

        cm = lucid.compile(model.to('metal'))
        opt = lucid.optim.Adam(cm.parameters(), lr=1e-3)
        for batch, target in loader:
            loss = cm.step(batch, target, loss_fn=F.cross_entropy)
            loss.backward()

        On cache hit: bind the input tensors to the cached

        Typing
        ------
