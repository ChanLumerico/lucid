"""
lucid.compile._core.attention_probe — hardware capability probe for the
MPSGraph fused-attention miscompile.

Some GPU/OS combinations (observed: M1 Pro / macOS 26; NOT M4 Max / macOS 27)
pattern-match ``softmax(QKᵀ) @ V`` onto an internal fused-attention kernel that
silently produces WRONG results for a window of shapes (batch >= 3, sequence
length in [17, 24], head dim 64).  The compile emitters dodge it by emitting the
value-matmul transposed — ``a @ b == (bᵀ @ aᵀ)ᵀ`` — which breaks the pattern
match, but costs ~+70% on the attention path and is pure waste where the bug is
absent.

This probe runs once per process, compiles a known-bad envelope with the
workaround forced OFF, compares each result against the eager (always-correct)
reference, and pins the engine flag so the transpose only fires on affected
hardware.  It is **conservative by construction**: the flag defaults to -1
(apply the transpose), and this probe clears it to 0 (skip) only when EVERY
envelope shape matches eager.  Any divergence, compile fallthrough, or
unexpected error leaves the workaround ON.
