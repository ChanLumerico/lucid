"""
lucid.compile._core.fallback — Phase 1.4 eager-escape helpers.

When :class:`CompiledModule` cannot compile a given signature (a
forward that touches an op with no emitter, or that breaks an
invariant of the MPSGraph builder), it must fall back to the regular
eager forward.  This module factors the bookkeeping out of
:class:`CompiledModule` so the wrapper stays focused on the cache /
dispatch logic.

Three responsibilities:

1. Provide a :func:`run_eager` helper that calls ``model(*args,
   **kwargs)`` exactly the way the user would (no special arguments,
   no monkey-patching).
2. Maintain a per-:class:`CompiledModule` *blacklist* of signatures
   that already failed to compile, so we don't re-trace + re-attempt
   on every call.
3. Say that a fallback happened (:func:`_fallback_notice`), once per
   kind of reason, so a caller who asked for a compiled model and got
   an eager one finds out without having to know about
   ``LUCID_COMPILE_VERBOSE``.
