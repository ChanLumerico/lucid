"""Pre-compile gate: is a traced graph safe to compile with a symbolic batch axis?

A symbolic-batch compile aborts (uncatchably) or silently mis-shapes when the
graph bakes the batch dimension into a constant shape MPSGraph cannot infer:

* explicit ``broadcast_to`` / ``expand`` / ``repeat`` / ``tile`` (the target
  shape carries the batch);
* a ``concatenate`` / ``stack`` on the **batch axis** (dim 0) — the joined dim
  is ``2*B``, which the dim-0 symbolic machinery can't represent;
* a **batch-shaped factory** (``zeros`` / ``ones`` / ``full`` / ``arange`` /
  ``eye`` sized like the input, e.g. ``zeros_like(x)`` or an RNN's zero hidden
  init) — a constant with the batch in its shape;
* a **permutation that moves the batch axis** off dim 0 (``x.T``,
  ``permute(1, 0)``) — the symbolic machinery assumes the batch stays at
  dim 0, and the executable answered a traced-batch-shaped result for every
  batch, or aborted MPSGraph on the next ``reshape``;
* a **reduction over the batch axis** — a count that comes from the batch
  is a trace-time constant: ``std(x, dim=0)``'s Bessel factor ``n/(n-1)``
  is a ``full`` in the graph, and was applied to every batch size;
* an **axis-sensitive op on the batch axis** — splitting it (the number of
  pieces is the batch's), rolling it, taking its diagonal, gathering or
  scattering along it (the index's shape is the traced batch): wrong values,
  a wrong shape, or MPSGraph aborting on a gather.

This gate scans the trace once.  A ``False`` result routes the model to robust
per-shape static caching (correct, never crashes) instead of attempting
symbolic.  It is the safety net that lets ``dynamic=True`` default to *attempting*
symbolic: only graphs that pass the gate ride the single-executable path.

The *view* ops (reshape / flatten / squeeze / contiguous / reduce-squeeze) are
deliberately NOT gated here — they fail gracefully in the emitter (returning nil
when the batch isn't provably preserved at dim 0), so the compile simply retries
static.  Only the ops above, which abort uncatchably or corrupt silently, need
the up-front gate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : TraceGraph
        The recorded trace (its ``ops`` are scanned by name + attrs + shape).
    trace_batch : int
        The leading (batch) size of the user input at trace time — used to tell a
        batch-shaped factory (``zeros_like(x)`` → leading dim == ``trace_batch``)
        from a concrete-shaped one (a fixed positional-encoding table, say).
    batch_ids : set of int, optional
        Trace ids of the inputs that carry the batch.  The axis rules —
        permuting, reducing, splitting along axis 0 — apply only to ops fed,
        however indirectly, by one of them: splitting a fused q/k/v weight
        along its axis 0 has nothing to do with the batch.  ``None`` treats
        every op as fed by the batch.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        ``False`` if any op would bake the batch into a constant MPSGraph can't
        symbolicise; ``True`` otherwise.
