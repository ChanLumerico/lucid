"""Whether a traced attention is better left to eager's fused kernel (CHA-14).

The compiled graph lowers ``scaled_dot_product_attention`` to matmul,
softmax and matmul, and so writes the whole score matrix — batch × heads ×
queries × keys — to memory and reads it back twice.  Eager MLX runs a fused
kernel that never writes it.  Measured on an M4 Max, fp16, dim 1536 / 12
heads (a Wan DiT block over a KV cache, 4,680 queries):

==========  ======  ========  ===================
keys        eager   compiled  score matrix
==========  ======  ========  ===================
4,680       37.0    37.8 ms   0.5 GiB
9,360       53.9    58.6 ms   1.0 GiB
18,720      87.5    120.8 ms  2.0 GiB
==========  ======  ========  ===================

Self-attention up to 4,096 tokens (≤ 0.4 GiB) matched eager to within 1%,
and MPSGraph's own fused attention (``LUCID_COMPILE_FUSED_SDPA=1``) changed
nothing — it materialises the scores as well.  So past half a GiB of scores
the call is routed to eager, where it is faster, with a one-time notice.
``LUCID_COMPILE_LONG_ATTENTION=compile`` keeps such calls compiled.
