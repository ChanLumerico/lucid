"""In-place writes to tensors from outside a traced call.

A traced forward that updates a tensor it did not create — one of its model's
buffers (an exponential moving average, a step counter, spectral norm's power
iterate), or any other tensor it holds — records the write like any other op,
but nothing asked for the value it produced: the executable pruned it, and
every compiled call left the tensor where the trace-time call had put it.
The update happened once.

Batch norm was the one case handled, by a kernel that leaves its buffers
alone under a tracer and hands the new statistics to the executable as extra
outputs (``bn_runstats``).  An in-place op cannot do that — by the time the
tracer sees it the write has happened — so this path works after the fact.
The tracer follows each write (``Tracer::on_inplace_write``) and keeps a copy
of every outside tensor from before its first one.  After the trace:

* every written tensor is put back to its value from before the trace, so
  whatever runs next — the executable, or an eager fallback — applies the
  write once, as an eager call does;
* its final id is asked of the executable as an extra output;
* after every run that output is copied into the tensor.

A write to one of the call's own arguments is not written back — the next
call's arguments are other tensors — and makes the call run eager, as does
any entry point that does not write back (:func:`refuse`).
