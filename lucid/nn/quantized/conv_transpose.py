class ConvTranspose1d(_QuantizedConvTransposeNd):
    r"""Quantized 1-D transposed (fractionally-strided) convolution.

    The int8-weight, dequantize-to-float replacement that
    :func:`lucid.quantization.convert` installs for a calibrated float
    :class:`~lucid.nn.ConvTranspose1d`. Transposed convolutions *upsample* — they
    are the decoder / generator counterpart of :class:`~lucid.nn.quantized.Conv1d`
    in 1-D signal models — and share the exact sidecar recipe of the quantized
    :class:`~lucid.nn.quantized.Conv2d` family.

    **Representation (sidecar design B).** The learned float kernel is quantized
    once, at :meth:`from_float` time, into an ``int8`` code tensor plus a
    per-output-channel ``scale`` / ``zero_point``; the float kernel is then
    dropped. Only the int8 codes, the qparams, and the (still-float) bias live in
    the module. Each forward *dequantizes* the kernel back to float, runs the
    ordinary ``F.conv_transpose1d``, and finally *fake-quantizes* the output onto
    the activation grid that calibration observed. Keeping the transposed
    convolution itself in float means the result matches a genuine int8 kernel to
    within a rounding step **and** the layer runs unchanged on any device.

    **Per-channel weights (axis 1).** The transposed-weight layout ``(in_channels,
    out_channels/groups, k)`` places the *output* channels on **axis 1**, not axis
    0, so the kernel is quantized per-channel along axis 1 — each output channel
    gets its own scale, far tighter than one per-tensor scale for wide kernels.
    The scheme is **symmetric** (``qint8``, ``zero_point = 0``), matching the
    reference default for transposed weights; the bias stays float.

    Encoding happens once (at :meth:`from_float`); decode + transposed-convolve run
    on every forward:

    .. math::

        w^{q}_{c,o,k} = \operatorname{clamp}\!\bigl(
            \operatorname{round}(w_{c,o,k}/s_o),\ -128,\ 127\bigr),
        \qquad
        \hat{w}_{c,o,k} = w^{q}_{c,o,k}\, s_o

    .. math::

        y = \operatorname{fake\_quant}\!\bigl(
            \operatorname{convT1d}(x, \hat{w}) + b\bigr),
        \qquad
        \operatorname{fake\_quant}(t) = \bigl(
            \operatorname{clamp}(\operatorname{round}(t/S) + Z,\ q_{\min},\ q_{\max})
            - Z\bigr)\, S

    where :math:`s_o` is the per-output-channel (axis-1) weight scale — with a zero
    zero-point because the weight scheme is symmetric — and :math:`S, Z` the scalar
    calibrated output ``(scale, zero_point)`` with grid bounds
    :math:`q_{\min}, q_{\max}` (``0, 255`` for the default ``quint8``).

    Parameters
    ----------
    in_channels : int
        Number of channels in the input signal.
    out_channels : int
        Number of channels produced by the transposed convolution — quantized
        per-channel (on axis 1 of the transposed weight).
    kernel_size : int or tuple of int
        Size of the convolving kernel.
    stride : int or tuple of int
        Stride of the transposed convolution (the upsampling factor).
    padding : int or tuple of int
        Implicit zero-padding subtracted from both sides of the spatial axis.
    output_padding : int or tuple of int
        Extra size added to one side of the output to disambiguate its shape.
    dilation : int or tuple of int
        Spacing between kernel elements.
    groups : int
        Number of blocked connections from input to output channels.
    bias : bool
        Whether a learned **float** bias term is added after the convolution.

    Attributes
    ----------
    weight_int8 : Tensor
        The ``int8`` kernel codes, shape ``(in_channels, out_channels/groups, k)``.
    weight_scale : Tensor
        Per-output-channel weight scale, shape ``(out_channels/groups,)``.
    weight_zero_point : Tensor
        Per-output-channel weight zero-point, shape ``(out_channels/groups,)`` —
        all zero under the symmetric scheme.
    scale : Tensor
        Scalar output-activation scale, set from the calibrated observer.
    zero_point : Tensor
        Scalar output-activation zero-point, set from the calibrated observer.
    bias : Tensor or None
        The float bias of shape ``(out_channels,)``, or ``None``.

    Notes
    -----
    - Instances are normally produced by :func:`lucid.quantization.convert` (or
      :meth:`from_float`), **not** constructed directly: a freshly constructed
      layer has identity qparams (``scale = 1``, ``zero_point = 0``) and zeroed
      kernel codes, and only becomes meaningful once ``from_float`` /
      ``load_state_dict`` fills the buffers.
    - Only int8 codes + qparams + float bias enter the ``state_dict``; the float
      kernel never does — the weight payload shrinks ~``3.55x`` (int8), and a
      whole conv-heavy checkpoint ~``3.97x`` (measured on ``resnet_18``).
    - The kernel is quantized **per-channel on axis 1** (the output-channel axis
      of the ``(in, out/groups, k)`` layout) with a **symmetric** ``qint8`` scheme
      (``from_float`` runs a fresh ``PerChannelMinMaxObserver`` over the weight);
      the bias stays float.
    - This layer wins on **memory**, not compute — the transposed convolution runs
      in float (CPU stream = Accelerate, GPU stream = MLX), so its speed tracks the
      float layer's; the payoff is the smaller checkpoint and working set.
    - Device-transparent: because compute stays in float, the layer runs unchanged
      on CPU or Metal and follows the input tensor's device.
    - Calibration is required — the output ``(scale, zero_point)`` come from an
      activation observer that must see representative data between ``prepare`` and
      ``convert``; an uncalibrated observer keeps its ``±inf`` seed, collapsing the
      output toward zero (``from_float`` warns).
    - Only integer / tuple padding is supported; string padding raises
      ``NotImplementedError`` at ``from_float``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import lucid, lucid.nn as nn
    >>> import lucid.quantization as Q
    >>> model = nn.Sequential(nn.ConvTranspose1d(8, 4, 3))
    >>> model.qconfig = Q.get_default_qconfig()
    >>> prepared = Q.prepare(model)             # insert activation/weight observers
    >>> _ = prepared(lucid.randn(2, 8, 16))     # calibrate on representative data
    >>> qmodel = Q.convert(prepared)            # float -> quantized ConvTranspose1d
    >>> type(qmodel[0]).__name__
    'ConvTranspose1d'
    >>> qmodel(lucid.randn(2, 8, 16)).shape     # int8-weight upsampling
    (2, 4, 18)

    Constructing the layer directly is **not** a substitute for that workflow — a
    bare instance carries zeroed codes and identity qparams, so it returns garbage
    until ``from_float`` / ``load_state_dict`` populates the buffers:

    >>> broken = nn.quantized.ConvTranspose1d(
    ...     8, 4, (3,), (1,), (0,), (0,), (1,), 1, True
    ... )
    >>> bool((broken.weight_int8 == 0).all().item())
    True

    The volumetric upsampling layer (video / 3-D medical decoders), and the
    int8-weight, dequantize-to-float replacement that
    :func:`lucid.quantization.convert` installs for a calibrated float
    :class:`~lucid.nn.ConvTranspose3d`. It is the up-projection counterpart of
    :class:`~lucid.nn.quantized.Conv3d`, and shares the sidecar recipe of the
    quantized :class:`~lucid.nn.quantized.Conv2d` family.

    **Representation (sidecar design B).** The learned float kernel is quantized
    once, at :meth:`from_float` time, into an ``int8`` code tensor plus a
    per-output-channel ``scale`` / ``zero_point``; the float kernel is then
    dropped. Only the int8 codes, the qparams, and the (still-float) bias live in
    the module. Each forward *dequantizes* the kernel back to float, runs the
    ordinary ``F.conv_transpose3d``, and finally *fake-quantizes* the output onto
    the activation grid that calibration observed. Keeping the transposed
    convolution itself in float means the result matches a genuine int8 kernel to
    within a rounding step **and** the layer runs unchanged on any device.

    **Per-channel weights (axis 1).** The transposed-weight layout ``(in_channels,
    out_channels/groups, kd, kh, kw)`` places the *output* channels on **axis 1**,
    not axis 0, so the kernel is quantized per-channel along axis 1 — each output
    channel gets its own scale, far tighter than one per-tensor scale for the wide
    dynamic range of volumetric kernels. The scheme is **symmetric** (``qint8``,
    ``zero_point = 0``), matching the reference default; the bias stays float.

    Encoding happens once (at :meth:`from_float`); decode + transposed-convolve run
    on every forward:

    .. math::

        w^{q}_{c,o,d,i,j} = \operatorname{clamp}\!\bigl(
            \operatorname{round}(w_{c,o,d,i,j}/s_o),\ -128,\ 127\bigr),
        \qquad
        \hat{w}_{c,o,d,i,j} = w^{q}_{c,o,d,i,j}\, s_o

    .. math::

        y = \operatorname{fake\_quant}\!\bigl(
            \operatorname{convT3d}(x, \hat{w}) + b\bigr),
        \qquad
        \operatorname{fake\_quant}(t) = \bigl(
            \operatorname{clamp}(\operatorname{round}(t/S) + Z,\ q_{\min},\ q_{\max})
            - Z\bigr)\, S

    where :math:`s_o` is the per-output-channel (axis-1) weight scale — with a zero
    zero-point because the weight scheme is symmetric — and :math:`S, Z` the scalar
    calibrated output ``(scale, zero_point)`` with grid bounds
    :math:`q_{\min}, q_{\max}` (``0, 255`` for the default ``quint8``).

    Parameters
    ----------
    in_channels : int
        Number of channels in the input volume.
    out_channels : int
        Number of channels produced by the transposed convolution — quantized
        per-channel (on axis 1 of the transposed weight).
    kernel_size : int or tuple of int
        Size of the convolving kernel.
    stride : int or tuple of int
        Stride of the transposed convolution (the upsampling factor).
    padding : int or tuple of int
        Implicit zero-padding subtracted from both sides of each spatial dim.
    output_padding : int or tuple of int
        Extra size added to one side of each output spatial dim.
    dilation : int or tuple of int
        Spacing between kernel elements.
    groups : int
        Number of blocked connections from input to output channels.
    bias : bool
        Whether a learned **float** bias term is added after the convolution.

    Attributes
    ----------
    weight_int8 : Tensor
        The ``int8`` kernel codes, shape
        ``(in_channels, out_channels/groups, kd, kh, kw)``.
    weight_scale : Tensor
        Per-output-channel weight scale, shape ``(out_channels/groups,)``.
    weight_zero_point : Tensor
        Per-output-channel weight zero-point, shape ``(out_channels/groups,)`` —
        all zero under the symmetric scheme.
    scale : Tensor
        Scalar output-activation scale, set from the calibrated observer.
    zero_point : Tensor
        Scalar output-activation zero-point, set from the calibrated observer.
    bias : Tensor or None
        The float bias of shape ``(out_channels,)``, or ``None``.

    Notes
    -----
    - Instances are normally produced by :func:`lucid.quantization.convert` (or
      :meth:`from_float`), **not** constructed directly: a freshly constructed
      layer has identity qparams (``scale = 1``, ``zero_point = 0``) and zeroed
      kernel codes, and only becomes meaningful once ``from_float`` /
      ``load_state_dict`` fills the buffers.
    - Only int8 codes + qparams + float bias enter the ``state_dict``; the float
      kernel never does — the weight payload shrinks ~``3.55x`` (int8), and a
      whole conv-heavy checkpoint ~``3.97x`` (measured on ``resnet_18``).
    - The kernel is quantized **per-channel on axis 1** (the output-channel axis
      of the ``(in, out/groups, kd, kh, kw)`` layout) with a **symmetric**
      ``qint8`` scheme (``from_float`` runs a fresh ``PerChannelMinMaxObserver``
      over the weight); the bias stays float.
    - This layer wins on **memory**, not compute — the transposed convolution runs
      in float (CPU stream = Accelerate, GPU stream = MLX), so its speed tracks the
      float layer's; the payoff is the smaller checkpoint and working set.
    - Device-transparent: because compute stays in float, the layer runs unchanged
      on CPU or Metal and follows the input tensor's device.
    - Calibration is required — the output ``(scale, zero_point)`` come from an
      activation observer that must see representative data between ``prepare`` and
      ``convert``; an uncalibrated observer keeps its ``±inf`` seed, collapsing the
      output toward zero (``from_float`` warns).
    - Only integer / tuple padding is supported; string padding raises
      ``NotImplementedError`` at ``from_float``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import lucid, lucid.nn as nn
    >>> import lucid.quantization as Q
    >>> model = nn.Sequential(nn.ConvTranspose3d(8, 4, 2, stride=2))
    >>> model.qconfig = Q.get_default_qconfig()
    >>> prepared = Q.prepare(model)                  # insert observers
    >>> _ = prepared(lucid.randn(1, 8, 4, 8, 8))     # calibrate on representative data
    >>> qmodel = Q.convert(prepared)                 # float -> quantized ConvTranspose3d
    >>> type(qmodel[0]).__name__
    'ConvTranspose3d'
    >>> qmodel(lucid.randn(1, 8, 4, 8, 8)).shape     # int8-weight 2x upsampling
    (1, 4, 8, 16, 16)

    Constructing the layer directly is **not** a substitute for that workflow — a
    bare instance carries zeroed codes and identity qparams, so it returns garbage
    until ``from_float`` / ``load_state_dict`` populates the buffers:

    >>> broken = nn.quantized.ConvTranspose3d(
    ...     8, 4, (2, 2, 2), (2, 2, 2), (0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), 1, True
    ... )
    >>> bool((broken.weight_int8 == 0).all().item())
    True
