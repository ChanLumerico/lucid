class Conv1d(_QuantizedConvNd):
    r"""Quantized 1-D convolution — int8 kernel, dequantize-to-float compute.

    The inference-time replacement that :func:`lucid.quantization.convert`
    installs in place of a calibrated float :class:`~lucid.nn.Conv1d`. It is the
    quantized member of the 1-D conv family — audio / time-series front ends,
    1-D residual stacks, token-mixing convolutions — and shares the exact sidecar
    recipe of the quantized :class:`~lucid.nn.quantized.Linear`.

    **Representation (sidecar design B).** The learned float kernel is quantized
    once, at :meth:`from_float` time, into an ``int8`` code tensor plus a
    per-output-channel ``scale`` / ``zero_point``; the float kernel is then
    dropped. Only the int8 codes, the qparams, and the (still-float) bias live in
    the module, so the checkpoint is far smaller than the float layer's. Each
    forward *dequantizes* the kernel back to float, runs the ordinary
    ``F.conv1d``, and finally *fake-quantizes* the output onto the activation grid
    that calibration observed. Keeping the convolution itself in float means the
    result matches a genuine int8 kernel to within a rounding step **and** the
    layer runs unchanged on any device, with no int8 conv kernel required.

    **Per-channel weights.** The kernel ``(out_channels, in_channels/groups, k)``
    is quantized independently for every output channel (axis 0): each filter
    carries its own scale and zero-point. Because different output filters often
    span very different dynamic ranges, per-channel quantization tracks them far
    more tightly than a single per-tensor scale, and is the standard
    accuracy-preserving choice for convolution kernels. The bias is small and
    precision-sensitive, so it is left in float.

    Encoding happens once (at :meth:`from_float`); decode + convolve run on every
    forward:

    .. math::

        w^{q}_{o,c,k} = \operatorname{clamp}\!\bigl(
            \operatorname{round}(w_{o,c,k}/s_o) + z_o,\ -128,\ 127\bigr),
        \qquad
        \hat{w}_{o,c,k} = (w^{q}_{o,c,k} - z_o)\, s_o

    .. math::

        y = \operatorname{fake\_quant}\!\bigl(
            \operatorname{conv1d}(x, \hat{w}) + b\bigr),
        \qquad
        \operatorname{fake\_quant}(t) = \bigl(
            \operatorname{clamp}(\operatorname{round}(t/S) + Z,\ q_{\min},\ q_{\max})
            - Z\bigr)\, S

    where :math:`s_o, z_o` are the per-output-channel weight scale / zero-point
    (index :math:`o` runs over ``out_channels``) and :math:`S, Z` the scalar
    calibrated output ``(scale, zero_point)`` with grid bounds
    :math:`q_{\min}, q_{\max}` (``0, 255`` for the default ``quint8``). The
    decode → float-conv → re-quantize round-trip is what makes the output
    *bit-equivalent* to a true int8 kernel without needing one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    in_channels : int
        Number of channels in the input signal.
    out_channels : int
        Number of channels produced by the convolution — quantized per-channel.
    kernel_size : int or tuple of int
        Size of the convolving kernel.
    stride : int or tuple of int
        Stride of the convolution.
    padding : int or tuple of int
        Implicit zero-padding added to both sides of the spatial axis.
    dilation : int or tuple of int
        Spacing between kernel elements.
    groups : int
        Number of blocked connections from input to output channels.
    bias : bool
        Whether a learned **float** bias term is added after the convolution.

    Attributes
    ----------
    weight_int8 : Tensor
        The ``int8`` kernel codes, shape ``(out_channels, in_channels/groups, k)``.
    weight_scale : Tensor
        Per-output-channel weight scale, shape ``(out_channels,)``.
    weight_zero_point : Tensor
        Per-output-channel weight zero-point, shape ``(out_channels,)``.
    scale : Tensor
        Scalar output-activation scale, set from the calibrated observer.
    zero_point : Tensor
        Scalar output-activation zero-point, set from the calibrated observer.
    bias : Tensor or None
        The float bias of shape ``(out_channels,)``, or ``None``.

    Notes
    -----
    - Instances are normally produced by :func:`lucid.quantization.convert` (or
      :meth:`from_float`), **not** constructed directly: a freshly constructed
      layer has identity qparams (``scale = 1``, ``zero_point = 0``) and zeroed
      kernel codes, and only becomes meaningful once ``from_float`` /
      ``load_state_dict`` fills the buffers.
    - Only int8 codes + qparams + float bias enter the ``state_dict``; the float
      kernel never does. The weight payload shrinks ~``3.55x`` (int8) and a whole
      model checkpoint ~``3.97x`` (measured on ``resnet_18``, a conv-heavy net).
    - The kernel is quantized **per-output-channel on axis 0** — each filter gets
      its own scale / zero-point, far tighter than one per-tensor scale for wide
      kernels; the bias stays float.
    - This layer wins on **memory**, not compute — the convolution runs in float
      (CPU stream = Accelerate, GPU stream = MLX), so its speed tracks the float
      layer's. There is no weight-only int8 *conv* GEMM analogue of
      :class:`~lucid.nn.quantized.QuantizedLinearMLX`; the payoff is the smaller
      checkpoint and working set.
    - Device-transparent: because compute stays in float, the layer runs
      unchanged on CPU or Metal and follows the input tensor's device.
    - Calibration is required — the output ``(scale, zero_point)`` come from an
      activation observer that must see representative data between ``prepare``
      and ``convert``; an uncalibrated observer keeps its ``±inf`` seed,
      collapsing ``scale`` toward ``eps`` and the output toward zero
      (``from_float`` warns loudly in that case).
    - Only integer / tuple padding with ``padding_mode="zeros"`` is supported;
      string ``"same"`` / ``"valid"`` padding raises ``NotImplementedError`` at
      ``from_float``.
    - ``_activation`` is the identity here; the fused
      :class:`~lucid.nn.quantized.ConvReLU1d` overrides it to apply ReLU *before*
      the output fake-quant so calibration and inference see the same post-ReLU
      range.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import lucid, lucid.nn as nn
    >>> import lucid.quantization as Q
    >>> model = nn.Sequential(nn.Conv1d(8, 16, 3))
    >>> model.qconfig = Q.get_default_qconfig()
    >>> prepared = Q.prepare(model)             # insert activation/weight observers
    >>> _ = prepared(lucid.randn(4, 8, 32))     # calibrate on representative data
    >>> qmodel = Q.convert(prepared)            # float Conv1d -> quantized Conv1d
    >>> type(qmodel[0]).__name__
    'Conv1d'
    >>> qmodel(lucid.randn(4, 8, 32)).shape     # int8-weight inference
    (4, 16, 30)

    Constructing the layer directly is **not** a substitute for that workflow — a
    bare instance carries zeroed codes and identity qparams, so it returns garbage
    until ``from_float`` / ``load_state_dict`` populates the buffers:

    >>> broken = nn.quantized.Conv1d(8, 16, (3,), (1,), (0,), (1,), 1, True)
    >>> bool((broken.weight_int8 == 0).all().item())
    True

    :func:`lucid.quantization.convert` installs for a calibrated float
    :class:`~lucid.nn.Conv3d`. Volumetric kernels are the largest weights in a
    3-D net, so the int8 checkpoint / working-set savings matter most here.

    **Representation (sidecar design B).** The learned float kernel is quantized
    once, at :meth:`from_float` time, into an ``int8`` code tensor plus a
    per-output-channel ``scale`` / ``zero_point``; the float kernel is then
    dropped. Only the int8 codes, the qparams, and the (still-float) bias live in
    the module, so the checkpoint is far smaller than the float layer's. Each
    forward *dequantizes* the kernel back to float, runs the ordinary
    ``F.conv3d``, and finally *fake-quantizes* the output onto the activation grid
    that calibration observed. Keeping the convolution itself in float means the
    result matches a genuine int8 kernel to within a rounding step **and** the
    layer runs unchanged on any device, with no int8 conv kernel required.

    **Per-channel weights.** The kernel ``(out_channels, in_channels/groups, kd,
    kh, kw)`` is quantized independently for every output channel (axis 0): each
    filter carries its own scale and zero-point. Because different output filters
    often span very different dynamic ranges, per-channel quantization tracks them
    far more tightly than a single per-tensor scale, and is the standard
    accuracy-preserving choice for convolution kernels. The bias is small and
    precision-sensitive, so it is left in float.

    Encoding happens once (at :meth:`from_float`); decode + convolve run on every
    forward:

    .. math::

        w^{q}_{o,c,d,i,j} = \operatorname{clamp}\!\bigl(
            \operatorname{round}(w_{o,c,d,i,j}/s_o) + z_o,\ -128,\ 127\bigr),
        \qquad
        \hat{w}_{o,c,d,i,j} = (w^{q}_{o,c,d,i,j} - z_o)\, s_o

    .. math::

        y = \operatorname{fake\_quant}\!\bigl(
            \operatorname{conv3d}(x, \hat{w}) + b\bigr),
        \qquad
        \operatorname{fake\_quant}(t) = \bigl(
            \operatorname{clamp}(\operatorname{round}(t/S) + Z,\ q_{\min},\ q_{\max})
            - Z\bigr)\, S

    where :math:`s_o, z_o` are the per-output-channel weight scale / zero-point
    (index :math:`o` runs over ``out_channels``) and :math:`S, Z` the scalar
    calibrated output ``(scale, zero_point)`` with grid bounds
    :math:`q_{\min}, q_{\max}` (``0, 255`` for the default ``quint8``). The
    decode → float-conv → re-quantize round-trip is what makes the output
    *bit-equivalent* to a true int8 kernel without needing one.

        The float bias of shape ``(out_channels,)``, or ``None``.

    Notes
    -----
    - Instances are normally produced by :func:`lucid.quantization.convert` (or
      :meth:`from_float`), **not** constructed directly: a freshly constructed
      layer has identity qparams (``scale = 1``, ``zero_point = 0``) and zeroed
      kernel codes, and only becomes meaningful once ``from_float`` /
      ``load_state_dict`` fills the buffers.
    - Only int8 codes + qparams + float bias enter the ``state_dict``; the float
      kernel never does. The weight payload shrinks ~``3.55x`` (int8) and a whole
      model checkpoint ~``3.97x`` (measured on ``resnet_18``, a conv-heavy net).
    - The kernel is quantized **per-output-channel on axis 0** — each filter gets
      its own scale / zero-point, far tighter than one per-tensor scale for wide
      kernels; the bias stays float.
    - This layer wins on **memory**, not compute — the convolution runs in float
      (CPU stream = Accelerate, GPU stream = MLX), so its speed tracks the float
      layer's. There is no weight-only int8 *conv* GEMM analogue of
      :class:`~lucid.nn.quantized.QuantizedLinearMLX`; the payoff is the smaller
      checkpoint and working set.
    - Device-transparent: because compute stays in float, the layer runs
      unchanged on CPU or Metal and follows the input tensor's device.
    - Calibration is required — the output ``(scale, zero_point)`` come from an
      activation observer that must see representative data between ``prepare``
      and ``convert``; an uncalibrated observer keeps its ``±inf`` seed,
      collapsing ``scale`` toward ``eps`` and the output toward zero
      (``from_float`` warns loudly in that case).
    - Only integer / tuple padding with ``padding_mode="zeros"`` is supported;
      string ``"same"`` / ``"valid"`` padding raises ``NotImplementedError`` at
      ``from_float``.
    - ``_activation`` is the identity here; the fused
      :class:`~lucid.nn.quantized.ConvReLU3d` overrides it to apply ReLU *before*
      the output fake-quant so calibration and inference see the same post-ReLU
      range.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import lucid, lucid.nn as nn
    >>> import lucid.quantization as Q
    >>> model = nn.Sequential(nn.Conv3d(3, 8, 3))
    >>> model.qconfig = Q.get_default_qconfig()
    >>> prepared = Q.prepare(model)                  # insert observers
    >>> _ = prepared(lucid.randn(1, 3, 8, 16, 16))   # calibrate on representative data
    >>> qmodel = Q.convert(prepared)                 # float Conv3d -> quantized Conv3d
    >>> type(qmodel[0]).__name__
    'Conv3d'
    >>> qmodel(lucid.randn(1, 3, 8, 16, 16)).shape   # int8-weight inference
    (1, 8, 6, 14, 14)

    Constructing the layer directly is **not** a substitute for that workflow — a
    bare instance carries zeroed codes and identity qparams, so it returns garbage
    until ``from_float`` / ``load_state_dict`` populates the buffers:

    >>> broken = nn.quantized.Conv3d(3, 8, (3, 3, 3), (1, 1, 1), (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), 1, True)
    >>> bool((broken.weight_int8 == 0).all().item())
    True
