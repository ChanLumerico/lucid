class GradScaler:
    r"""Dynamic loss-scaling helper for mixed-precision training.

    Mixed-precision training runs the forward pass in fp16 to halve
    memory bandwidth and exploit fp16-fast hardware paths, but
    fp16's narrow dynamic range causes small gradients to underflow to
    zero — the network stops learning.  :class:`GradScaler` works
    around this by multiplying the loss by a large constant :math:`s`
    before backpropagation:

    .. math::

        \tilde{L} = s \cdot L, \qquad
        \frac{\partial \tilde{L}}{\partial \theta}
        = s \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta}.

    The scaled gradients sit comfortably inside fp16's representable
    range; before the optimizer step they are unscaled by :math:`1/s`
    in fp32 so the update is mathematically equivalent to ordinary
    training.

    The scale itself is adapted dynamically.  After every step the
    unscaled gradients are checked for ``inf`` / ``NaN``:

    * **Overflow detected** — the step is skipped and :math:`s` is
      multiplied by ``backoff_factor`` (typically ``0.5``).
    * **No overflow for ``growth_interval`` consecutive steps** —
      :math:`s` is multiplied by ``growth_factor`` (typically ``2.0``).

    This produces a sawtooth schedule that tracks the largest scale
    the current gradient distribution can tolerate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    init_scale : float, default=2**16
        Initial loss scaling factor applied by :meth:`scale`.
    growth_factor : float, default=2.0
        Multiplier applied to the scale after ``growth_interval``
        consecutive non-overflowing steps.  Must be ``> 1.0``.
    backoff_factor : float, default=0.5
        Multiplier applied when an ``inf`` / ``NaN`` gradient is
        detected.  Must be in ``(0, 1)``.
    growth_interval : int, default=2000
        Number of overflow-free steps required before the scale grows.
    enabled : bool, default=True
        When ``False`` the scaler degenerates into a transparent
        pass-through — :meth:`scale` returns its input unchanged,
        :meth:`step` calls the optimizer directly, and :meth:`update`
        is a no-op.

    Notes
    -----
    The canonical training-loop pattern is *scale-loss, then step,
    then update*:

    1. :meth:`scale` multiplies the loss by :math:`s` before
       ``backward()`` so the gradients land safely inside fp16 range.
    2. :meth:`step` unscales the gradients, checks for ``inf`` /
       ``NaN``, and either runs ``optimizer.step()`` or skips the
       update.
    3. :meth:`update` adjusts :math:`s` according to the
       growth / backoff schedule for the next iteration.

    To work on the real gradients between ``backward()`` and the step —
    gradient clipping is the usual reason — call :meth:`unscale_` first.
    The scaler remembers, per optimizer, that its gradients are already
    unscaled, so the following :meth:`step` does not divide them a second
    time.  Each optimizer moves through *ready → unscaled → stepped* once
    per iteration and :meth:`update` returns every optimizer to *ready*;
    calling :meth:`unscale_` twice, :meth:`unscale_` after :meth:`step`, or
    :meth:`step` twice before :meth:`update` raises :class:`RuntimeError`.

    With several optimizers on one scaler, an overflow in one optimizer's
    gradients skips only that optimizer's step; :meth:`update` backs the
    scale off if any optimizer overflowed.

    The parameters themselves stay float32: :class:`lucid.amp.autocast`
    moves the forward pass into half precision, not the weights, so the
    gradients arrive in float32 too.  bfloat16 and float64 gradients are
    unscaled as well, and unscaling never changes a gradient's dtype.  A
    float16 gradient — from a float16 parameter — makes :meth:`unscale_`
    and :meth:`step` raise :class:`ValueError`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import lucid
    >>> import lucid.nn as nn
    >>> import lucid.optim as optim
    >>> from lucid.amp import GradScaler, autocast
    >>> model = nn.Linear(4, 1).to("metal")
    >>> optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    >>> loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
    >>> dataloader = [
    ...     (lucid.randn(8, 4, device="metal"), lucid.randn(8, 1, device="metal"))
    ...     for _ in range(3)
    ... ]
    >>> scaler = GradScaler()
    >>> for x, y in dataloader:
    ...     optimizer.zero_grad()
    ...     with autocast():
    ...         out = model(x)
    ...     loss = loss_fn(out.float(), y)
    ...     scaler.scale(loss).backward()
    ...     scaler.step(optimizer)
    ...     scaler.update()

    Clipping the unscaled gradients — :meth:`step` sees that
    :meth:`unscale_` already ran and leaves them alone:

    >>> from lucid.nn.utils import clip_grad_norm_
    >>> x, y = dataloader[0]
    >>> optimizer.zero_grad()
    >>> scaler.scale(loss_fn(model(x), y)).backward()

        Float16 gradients are refused, as the reference framework refuses

        assumes float32 master weights: :class:`lucid.amp.autocast` runs
        the forward in half precision while the parameters and their

        scale ``2**16`` puts most of its entries below float16's smallest
        normal value ``6.1e-5``.  Metal flushes those subnormals to zero.
