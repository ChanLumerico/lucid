Gradient checkpointing (``lucid.autograd.checkpoint``).

Gradient checkpointing trades compute for memory: instead of storing
all intermediate activations during the forward pass, only the inputs
to a *segment* are kept.  During the backward pass the segment is
re-executed under ``enable_grad`` to rebuild the local computation graph,
then backpropagated through it.

This is especially useful for large models (transformers, deep ResNets)
where GPU memory is the bottleneck.

Usage
-----
.. code-block:: python

    from lucid.autograd import checkpoint

    def segment(x):
        return model_block(x)

    y = checkpoint(segment, x)    # memory-efficient
    loss = criterion(y, target)
    loss.backward()

Notes
-----
* ``function`` may return one tensor or a tuple of them; each output's
  gradient seeds the recomputed graph.
* RNG state is saved before the forward and restored for the
  recomputation (``preserve_rng_state=True``, the default), so a dropout
  inside the segment masks the same units both times.  Without it the
  recomputed segment drew a fresh mask and the gradient belonged to a
  different network than the one that produced the loss.
* ``use_reentrant=True`` (the default, for compatibility) derives the
  output's ``requires_grad`` from the positional inputs alone, so a
  segment fed only constants produces no gradient for the parameters it
  closes over — silently, while the same block without ``checkpoint``
  trains.  ``use_reentrant=False`` keeps the node in the graph and is the
  safer choice; it is the default in the reference framework for the
  same reason.

    """Run *function* under gradient checkpointing.

    Executes ``function(*args, **kwargs)`` during the forward pass
    **without** tracking intermediate activations (``no_grad`` context).
    During the backward pass the function is re-executed under
    ``enable_grad`` to reconstruct the local autograd graph, and the
    gradients are computed through that graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    function : callable
        The differentiable segment to checkpoint.  Must accept tensors as
        positional arguments and return a :class:`~lucid.Tensor` or a
        tuple of them.
    *args : Tensor
        Positional tensor inputs to *function*.
    preserve_rng_state : bool
        Restore the random state the forward saw before recomputing, so
        stochastic layers draw the same values twice.  Default ``True``.
    use_reentrant : bool
        ``True`` (default, kept for backward compatibility) ties the
        recomputation to the positional inputs: if none of them requires
        grad, backward never runs and nothing inside the segment receives
        a gradient — including parameters it closed over.  ``False``
        anchors the node in the graph so the segment is always recomputed
        and those parameters accumulate normally.  Prefer ``False``
        unless something depends on the old behaviour.
    **kwargs
        Extra keyword arguments forwarded to *function* on both the
        forward and recomputation passes.

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor or tuple of Tensor
        Output of ``function(*args, **kwargs)``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import lucid
    >>> W = lucid.tensor([[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0]], requires_grad=True)
    >>> b = lucid.tensor([0.0, 0.0], requires_grad=True)
    >>> x = lucid.tensor([[1.0, -2.0]], requires_grad=True)
    >>> def block(x):
    ...     return lucid.nn.functional.relu(x @ W + b)
    >>> y = lucid.autograd.checkpoint(block, x, use_reentrant=False)
    >>> y.sum().backward()
    >>> x.grad
