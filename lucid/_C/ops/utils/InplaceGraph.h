// What an in-place op has to do to the autograd graph, in one place.
//
// There are two in-place families — the unary one in ``ufunc/Inplace.cpp``
// and the binary one in ``bfunc/Inplace.cpp`` — and they had drifted:
// the unary side learned to adopt the forward's grad_fn and the binary
// side never did, so ``x.mul_(y)`` returned the gradient of whatever
// produced ``x`` and ``y`` received none at all.  Sharing the rules is
// what keeps the two from disagreeing again.

// A leaf is where gradient accumulates, and an in-place write moves it
// without leaving anything behind that says so.  Nor is there a right
// number to return: after the write ``x`` *is* the result, so "the
// gradient with respect to x" names two different tensors depending on
// when it is asked.  The reference refuses the same setup for the same
// reason.  Callers that mean to overwrite say so with ``no_grad``, which
// is what every optimiser step already does.
//
// ``is_leaf()``, not ``!grad_fn()``: a leaf that has taken part in a
// forward carries its gradient accumulator as ``grad_fn``, so the old test
// stopped refusing the moment a parameter was first used — every in-place
// op on a trained parameter then went through, and the ones that rebind
// turned the parameter into a non-leaf that never received ``.grad``.

// read ``a`` as the write left it — the new values, and the new grad_fn,
// which is the node itself:
//
//     sin_                ->  cos(sin(x)) instead of cos(x)
//     buf.mul_(v)         ->  d/dv = buf * v instead of buf
//
// in graph mode only, since eager ``backward()`` reads the Storage.  So
// whenever the op records a node, the node is handed a tensor of its own:
// one that holds the values ``a`` holds now and sits where ``a`` sits now.
// ``a`` not requiring grad is no exception — the other operand of a binary
// op may, and its node saves this one.  Being its own tensor, it also keeps
// its own version count, which is what lets the write move ``a``'s
// (:func:`adopt_graph_position`) without the node refusing itself.
//
// The snapshot shares the buffer rather than copying it, and the caller's
// assignment replaces ``a``'s *slot* rather than the buffer, so the

// them.  No data is copied, and when no node is recorded — ``no_grad``, or
// no operand requiring grad — nothing is allocated either.

// A write that lands in the buffer (``TensorImpl::write_lands_in_buffer``:
// a CPU tensor with live views, or one read from ``.grad``) is the
// exception: a node holding the buffer would read the new values back, and
// the holder would stop the write besides — ``p.grad.add_(w)`` with ``w``
// requiring grad was refused as a gradient something else reads.  Its

//   ``a`` does not require grad it is cut from the graph, since those are a
//   constant's values;
