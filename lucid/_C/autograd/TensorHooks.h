// lucid/_C/autograd/TensorHooks.h
//
// Tensor gradient hooks and ``retain_grad``, run by the engine where the
// tensor's gradient is complete.
//
// A non-leaf tensor's gradient is the sum of everything that reaches its
// producer's output slot ``(grad_fn, grad_output_nr)``, so its hooks live on
// that node, slot by slot — the node holds them strongly, since the tensor
// itself is often gone by the time backward runs (consumers keep only weak
// handles on their inputs).  The engine runs them once the slot's gradient
// has arrived, before the node does, and what they return is what flows on.
// ``retain_grad`` is the same kind of slot entry, run after the hooks, so a
// retained gradient is the hooked one.
//
// A leaf's hooks live in its :class:`AutogradMeta` instead: its
// :class:`AccumulateGrad` is made lazily and dropped by ``release_root`` and
// ``detach_``, so a hook stored there would be lost.  They run before the
// gradient is accumulated into ``.grad``.
//
// What a hook *is* — the list of callables, their order, their removal — is
// Python's business.  Each slot holds one Python ``runner(grad) -> grad |
// None`` that Python installs once, and the engine calls only that.  A slot
// that was never asked for does not exist, so a backward pass with no hooks
// never touches Python.
//
// This file also owns what every gradient Python hands back has to pass
// before the engine uses it — a hook's, a module hook's, a custom Function's,
// ``Tensor.grad =``'s: one converter from Python and one check against the
// slot the gradient replaces (``tensor_from_python``, ``check_grad_kind``,
// ``grad_slot_buffer`` below).

// ----------
// runner : py::object
//     The Python callable that runs the tensor's hooks, or a null handle
//     while it has none (a slot made by ``retain_grad`` alone).
// retain : std::weak_ptr<TensorImpl>
//     The non-leaf tensor whose ``.grad`` keeps this slot's gradient, when
//     ``retain_grad`` asked for it.  Weak: the slot must not keep it alive.
// shape : Shape
//     The tensor's shape, to give a gradient Storage a shape again.
//
// Notes
// -----
// The runner is dropped under the GIL, wherever the last owner lets go of the
// slot — a node or a tensor can die on a thread that does not hold it.

// One pair of helpers for every traversal: eager backward and ``grad()`` hand
// over Storage, their ``create_graph`` forms hand over tensors.  Each returns
// the gradient that flows on.

// Run the hooks of output ``output_nr`` of ``producer`` on that slot's whole
// gradient, then retain the result if the tensor asked for it.
//
// The hooks run with the GIL held and grad mode off.  A hook that returned a
// tensor replaces the gradient — after the checks ``Tensor.grad =`` makes —
// and one that returned ``None`` leaves it as the hook left it, in-place
// writes included.  Once a hook has run, a CPU gradient is copied before it
// flows on: the hook may keep what it was handed, or hand back a tensor
// somebody else reads, and the engine adds into gradients in place.
//
// Raises
// ------
// py::error_already_set

// py::type_error

// The runner of ``t``'s hooks, installed from ``make()`` the first time.
//
// A leaf's slot is its own; a non-leaf's is its producer's output slot, so
// every consumer — made before the hook or after — sends its gradient through
// it.  ``t``'s shape is recorded with it.
//
// Notes
// -----
// A non-leaf's runner lives on its producer for as long as the node does.
// The engine drops it once ``backward(retain_graph=False)`` has released the
// node's saved state (:meth:`Node::release_tensor_hooks`) — the node can never
// run again, and dropping it breaks the cycle tensor → node → runner → hook
// closure → tensor that Python's collector cannot see through the engine.
// Two consequences the caller should know:
//
// * a hook registered on the output of a node that was *already* released
//   that way is installed but never fires (any further backward through the
//   node is refused), and it keeps that cycle until the node itself goes;
// * a node that saved nothing for backward is never released, so a hook on
//   its output that refers to the output keeps the cycle while the graph
//   lives — as does a hook on a graph that never runs backward at all.
//
// A leaf's runner lives in its own AutogradMeta, so a leaf hook that refers
// to the leaf keeps the leaf alive the same way.  The Python side
// (CHA-151-A) should hold the tensor weakly in its runner.
//
// Raises
// ------
// LucidError
//     ``t`` does not require grad, so no gradient will ever reach it.

// backward hook's tuple (ModuleHookNode.cpp), a custom Function's backward
// (CustomFunction.cpp — its shape, dtype and device are held to the input by
// ``lucid.autograd._python_node._validate`` first) and ``Tensor.grad =``.  A

// kind is not converted but refused: read as it was, a short buffer was read
// past its end and a float16 one had its bits taken for float32.
