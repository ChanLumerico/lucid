//
// Random draws inside a traced function, drawn again on every run.
//
// A compiled executable is a fixed graph.  An RNG op lowered into it with
// a seed draws the same values on every call: a diffusion model's noise
// and timesteps, a stochastic-depth mask, a VAE's reparameterisation
// sample — all frozen at their trace-time values, and training on them
// raises no error.  Instead the tracer turns each draw from the default
// generator into an ordinary feed and remembers how it was made, and
// :func:`run_executable` makes it again, through the same eager op, before
// binding the feeds.  Drawn in trace order, the values are exactly the
// ones eager would have produced from the same generator state, and the
// generator advances as it would have.
//
// The recipe lives beside the traced tensor, not in the executable: the
// executable only sees a placeholder, and one executable is shared by
// every trace with the same structure — a constant feed of the same shape
// must not start drawing.  The tensor is the pinned feed every entry
// point hands back to :func:`run_executable`, so each of them re-draws
// without knowing about it.
