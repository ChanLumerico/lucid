"""Deriving implicit Runge-Kutta tableaux instead of tabulating them.

Most implicit methods worth having are *collocation* methods: fix a set of
nodes inside the step and the entire coefficient table follows from requiring
the interpolating polynomial through those nodes to integrate exactly.  The
nodes themselves are roots of Legendre polynomials.

So none of it needs to be typed in.  That matters more here than elsewhere —
``gl6`` and ``radauIIA5`` have irrational coefficients, and a wall of
twenty-digit constants is exactly the transcription risk that still has
``dopri8`` on hold.  A wrong digit does not raise; it quietly costs an order,
which is the hardest kind of bug to notice.  Deriving them removes the risk
outright and makes the check free: a collocation method's order is fixed by
its node count, so the derivation can be verified against theory.

Everything here runs once at import, in 60-digit decimal, and lands in the
tableaux as ordinary floats.
