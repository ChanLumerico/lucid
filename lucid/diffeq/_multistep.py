"""Adams multistep integration.

A Runge-Kutta method buys accuracy by evaluating the right-hand side several
times inside one step.  A multistep method buys it by remembering the
derivatives it already computed: an order-``k`` Adams step reuses the last
``k`` values and costs a single new evaluation.  When the right-hand side is
expensive — a neural network, say — that trade is worth a lot.

The price is that it is not a one-step method.  There is no history at the
start, so the first few steps run on Runge-Kutta until enough has accumulated,
and the whole scheme is tied to a fixed grid: the coefficients below assume
evenly spaced past values.

Coefficients are derived rather than tabulated.  Adams weights are fixed by
requiring the interpolating polynomial through the remembered points to
integrate exactly, so they follow from that condition alone — computing them
in exact rationals removes any chance of a transcription slip in what would
otherwise be a wall of integer tables.

    They always sum to ``1`` — the consistency condition, and a cheap check

    Memoised: the weights depend on nothing but the arguments, and the exact

    Order ramps up as history accumulates: the first steps run RK4 because
    an Adams step of order below four has nothing to gain over it, and the
    order then rises to whatever the history and ``max_order`` allow.

    Uneven grid spacing silently breaks the coefficients, which assume
    evenly spaced past values — so a non-uniform ``t`` falls back to RK4
    throughout rather than producing a quietly wrong answer.
