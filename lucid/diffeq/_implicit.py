"""Implicit Runge-Kutta integration.

An explicit method computes its stages in order, each from the ones already
known.  An implicit one cannot: its stage equations reference themselves,

.. math::

    K_i = f\\!\\left(t + c_i h,\\; y + h \\textstyle\\sum_j a_{ij} K_j\\right)

with the sum running over *all* stages.  So every step solves a nonlinear
system.  That is far more expensive per step than an explicit method — and it
is worth it exactly when stability, not accuracy, is what limits the step
size.  On a stiff problem an explicit method is forced into steps far smaller
than the solution's own timescale; an implicit one is not, and wins on total
cost despite losing badly per step.

The system is solved with Broyden's method: a quasi-Newton iteration that
builds up an approximate Jacobian from the residuals it has already seen,
rather than computing a real one.  That keeps the solver from having to
differentiate the right-hand side — which would mean running nested autograd
inside a solve that may itself already be under grad — and matches what the
reference implementation does.

    Broyden approximates the Jacobian instead of computing one, updating it by
    the rank-one correction that makes it consistent with the step just taken:

    .. math::

        J \\leftarrow J + \\frac{(\\Delta F - J \\Delta x)\\,\\Delta x^{T}}
                                {\\Delta x^{T} \\Delta x}

    It starts from the identity, which is a poor Jacobian but a safe one — the
    first step is then simply ``-F``, and the approximation improves from
    there.

    Two ways out other than convergence, both of which return the current
    iterate rather than a wrong answer dressed up as a right one: a singular
    approximate Jacobian stops the iteration immediately, and exhausting
    ``max_iters`` warns.  Silence in either case would mean a step that looks
    successful and is not.
