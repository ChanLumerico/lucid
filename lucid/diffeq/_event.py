"""Integrating until a condition fires rather than to a fixed time.

Some problems do not end at a time you can name in advance — a trajectory ends
when it hits the ground, a simulation stops when a quantity crosses a
threshold.  ``event_fn(t, y)`` expresses that as a scalar whose sign change
marks the moment, and the solver runs until it flips.

Locating the moment precisely is what the interpolants built for dense output
are for: once a step brackets the crossing, the event time is found by
bisecting the polynomial that step already fitted, with no extra
right-hand-side evaluations along the way.

    Bisection reaches the event time through sign comparisons, and a
    comparison has no derivative, so the time arrives with no graph behind it.
    It is still a differentiable function of everything the trajectory depends
    on, because it is pinned by

    .. math::

        g(t^*, y(t^*)) = 0.

    Differentiating that identity along the trajectory and solving for
    :math:`t^*` gives

    .. math::

        \frac{\partial t^*}{\partial \theta}
        = -\frac{\partial_y g \cdot \partial_\theta y}
                {\partial_t g + \partial_y g \cdot f},

    which says a cotangent arriving at the event time can be turned into one
    on the state at the event -- and *that* is connected to ``y0`` and to any
    parameters.  So the node takes the state as its input and the time as its
    output, and its backward is the fraction above.

    The denominator is the total derivative of the event function along the
    trajectory.  It vanishes exactly when the event is tangential rather than
    transversal, which is the case where the event time genuinely has no
    derivative -- an arbitrarily small change can make the crossing disappear.
