"""Thin wrappers over the fused ``_C_engine.diffeq`` primitives.

Both the fixed-grid and the adaptive solver reduce almost all of their tensor
arithmetic to two engine calls, so the wrappers live here rather than in
either solver.

Engine ops are strict about dtype — promotion is the Python layer's job,
exactly as it is for ``Tensor.__add__``.  Getting that wrong is not a corner
case: under ``autocast`` on Metal the right-hand side returns float16 while
the state stays float32, and the mismatch is invisible on CPU because
autocast folds float16 back to float32 there.

    All of these are branched on every iteration, so they cross to the host no
