"""Explicit Runge-Kutta integration of ``dy/dt = f(t, y)``.

The public entry point :func:`odeint` lives here and dispatches on the
tableau: a tableau carrying an embedded error estimate goes to the adaptive
stepper in :mod:`lucid.diffeq._adaptive`, everything else to the fixed-grid
loop below.

The loop stays in Python on purpose.  The right-hand side is a Python callable
— typically a neural network — so driving the loop from C++ would force the
``ops`` layer to call back up into Python, inverting the engine's layer DAG.
What *does* live in C++ is the per-step arithmetic: every stage input and
every state update is the same affine form, fused into a single engine op.
That collapses roughly ten temporaries per RK4 step down to four.

The dominant cost of a solve is still the ``stages x steps`` right-hand-side
evaluations; the fusion trims the bandwidth-bound arithmetic around them, not
the network forwards themselves.

    r"""Integrate ``dy/dt = f(t, y)``.

    Four families are reachable through the same call, and which one runs
    follows from ``method``:

    **Adaptive** (the default, and anything carrying an embedded error
    estimate) treats ``t`` as *output* times.  The solver picks its own step
    sizes to hold the local error inside ``rtol`` / ``atol`` and interpolates
    to each requested time, so a coarse ``t`` costs nothing in accuracy.

    **Fixed step** (``euler`` / ``midpoint`` / ``heun2`` / ``heun3`` / ``rk4``
    / ``rk4_classic``)
    treats ``t`` as the integration grid itself by default: consecutive
    entries are one step each, with no sub-stepping and no interpolation.
    ``rtol`` / ``atol`` are unused there, and accuracy is controlled by
    choosing a finer grid — or by handing ``options["step_size"]``, which
    decouples the two the same way an adaptive method does.

    **Adams multistep** (``explicit_adams`` / ``implicit_adams`` /
    ``fixed_adams``) is fixed-step too, but reaches high order by reusing the
    derivatives from previous steps instead of taking more of them inside one
    step — one new evaluation per step regardless of order.  That pays off
    when ``func`` is expensive.  See ``options["max_order"]`` for the caveat
    that comes with it.

    Gradient mode is left entirely to the caller.  Under grad the whole solve
    is differentiable end-to-end (discretise-then-optimise) and every stage is
    retained for backward; wrap the call in :func:`lucid.no_grad` for sampling,
    where the stage graph is pure overhead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
        Right-hand side ``f(t, y) -> dy/dt``.  Receives the stage time as a
        0-D tensor matching ``y0`` in dtype and device, and must return a
        tensor with the same shape and device as ``y0``.
    y0 : Tensor
        Initial state at ``t[0]``.  Any shape; must have a floating dtype.
    t : Tensor or sequence of float
        Strictly monotonic 1-D grid of at least two finite time points.
        Descending grids integrate backwards in time.
    rtol : float, default=1e-7
        Relative tolerance.  Adaptive methods only.
    atol : float, default=1e-9
        Absolute tolerance.  Adaptive methods only.
    method : str or ButcherTableau or None, default=None
        ``None`` selects ``"dopri5"``.  Otherwise one of ``"dopri5"``,
        ``"tsit5"``, ``"bosh3"``, ``"fehlberg2"``, ``"adaptive_heun"``,
        ``"euler"``, ``"midpoint"``, ``"heun2"``, ``"heun3"``, ``"rk4"``,
        ``"rk4_classic"``,
        ``"explicit_adams"``, ``"implicit_adams"``, ``"fixed_adams"``,
        ``"implicit_euler"``, ``"implicit_midpoint"``, ``"trapezoid"``,
        ``"radauIIA3"``, ``"radauIIA5"``, ``"gl4"``, ``"gl6"``, ``"sdirk2"``,
        ``"trbdf2"``, or a custom :class:`ButcherTableau`.
    options : dict or None, default=None
        Per-method settings.  Adaptive methods accept ``min_step``,
        ``max_step``, ``first_step``, ``step_t``, ``jump_t``, ``safety``,
        ``ifactor``, ``dfactor``, ``max_num_steps`` (plus ``dtype`` and
        ``norm``, accepted and ignored).  Fixed-step methods accept
        ``step_size``, ``grid_constructor``, ``interp`` and ``perturb`` —
        giving either of the first two decouples the integration grid from
        ``t``, which is then reached by interpolation.  Adams methods accept
        all four of those plus ``max_order`` (default 12) and ``max_iters``
        (default 4, corrector sweeps, ignored by ``explicit_adams``).

        A high ``max_order`` is not simply more accurate.  Explicit Adams
        loses stability as the order climbs — at the default 12 its stable
        step is small enough that ``explicit_adams`` diverges on problems
        ``rk4`` handles comfortably — so lower it, or use one of the
        corrected variants, whose stability holds up far better.  Order also
        ramps from a Runge-Kutta start, which caps the accuracy the first
        steps can contribute regardless of ``max_order``.

        Implicit methods accept the fixed-step keys plus ``max_iters``
        (default 100), the ceiling on iterations of the nonlinear solve.  A
        step whose solve runs out of iterations warns rather than passing off
        an unconverged iterate as a completed step.
    event_fn : callable or None, default=None
        ``g(t, y)`` returning a single-element tensor.  When given, the solve
        ignores every entry of ``t`` but the first, runs until ``g`` changes
        sign, and returns a ``(event_t, solution)`` pair instead of a
        trajectory.  The direction of ``t`` still decides which way it
        searches.
    return_trajectory : bool, default=True
        Return the state at every time in ``t``.  Set ``False`` to keep only
        the final state — for a sampling run of many steps over a batch of
        images, stacking the full trajectory multiplies peak memory by the
        number of steps.  Ignored when ``event_fn`` is given.  **Lucid
        extension**, not part of the reference interface.

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor or tuple
        Without ``event_fn``: shape ``(len(t), *y0.shape)`` when
        ``return_trajectory`` is ``True`` (index 0 is ``y0`` itself),
        otherwise ``y0.shape``.  The dtype is the promotion of ``y0`` with
        everything ``func`` returns, matching what ``y + dt * k`` would
        produce.

        With ``event_fn``: a ``(event_t, solution)`` pair, where ``event_t``
        is a 0-D tensor and ``solution`` has shape ``(2, *y0.shape)`` — the
        state at ``t[0]`` and the state at the event.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``t`` is not a strictly monotonic 1-D grid of at least two finite
        points, if ``y0`` has a non-floating dtype, if ``method`` names no
        registered method, if ``options`` holds a key the method does not
        accept, or if ``func`` returns a tensor whose shape or device differs
        from ``y0``.
    TypeError
        If ``method`` is neither a string nor a :class:`ButcherTableau`, or
        if ``func`` returns something other than a tensor.
    RuntimeError
        If an adaptive solve exceeds ``max_num_steps`` or its step size
        collapses.

    Notes
    -----
    A fixed-step solve costs exactly ``(len(t) - 1) * method.stages`` calls to
    ``func``.  An adaptive solve costs as many as the tolerances demand, and
    reads one scalar back to the host per step to decide whether to accept it
    — that host synchronisation is intrinsic to adaptivity, which is why the
    two families have different performance characters.

    Higher-order differentiation works: the fused step opts into
    graph-recording backward, so ``create_graph=True`` through a solve behaves
    exactly as it would for the unfused arithmetic.

    Examples
    --------
    Exponential decay against its closed form:

    >>> import lucid, lucid.diffeq as diffeq
    >>> y0 = lucid.tensor([1.0], dtype=lucid.float64)
    >>> y = diffeq.odeint(lambda s, y: -y, y0, [0.0, 1.0], return_trajectory=False)
    >>> abs(float(y.item()) - 0.36787944117) < 1e-8

    r"""Solve once across an interval and return a continuous solution.

    Where :func:`odeint` wants the output times up front, this integrates
    ``[t0, t1]`` a single time and hands back a function of ``t``.  Every
    step's interpolating polynomial is kept, so any later query costs a
    binary search and one polynomial evaluation — no re-integration, and no
    commitment to a grid before you know which times you need.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
        Right-hand side ``f(t, y) -> dy/dt``.  Receives the stage time as a
        0-D tensor matching ``y0`` in dtype and device, and must return a
        tensor with the same shape and device as ``y0``.
    y0 : Tensor
        Initial state at ``t0``.  Any shape; must have a floating dtype.
    t0, t1 : float
        Ends of the interval.  ``t1 < t0`` integrates backwards.
    rtol : float, default=1e-7
        Relative tolerance.  Adaptive methods only.
    atol : float, default=1e-9
        Absolute tolerance.  Adaptive methods only.
    method : str or ButcherTableau or None, default=None
        ``None`` selects ``"dopri5"``.  See :func:`odeint` for the full list.
    options : dict or None, default=None
        Per-method settings, exactly as :func:`odeint` takes them.

    Returns
    -------
    callable
        ``dense(t) -> Tensor``, accepting a float or a 0-D tensor and
        returning the state there.  Raises :class:`ValueError` for a time
        outside ``[t0, t1]``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``t0`` and ``t1`` are equal or non-finite, if ``y0`` has a
        non-floating dtype, if ``method`` names no registered method, if
        ``options`` holds a key the method does not accept, or if ``func``
        returns a tensor whose shape or device differs from ``y0``.
    TypeError
        If ``method`` is neither a string nor a :class:`ButcherTableau`, or
        if ``func`` returns something other than a tensor.
    RuntimeError
        If an adaptive solve exceeds ``max_num_steps`` or its step size
        collapses.

    Notes
    -----
    Memory grows with the number of accepted steps: each keeps a handful of
    tensors the size of the state.  A long solve over a large state is
    therefore much heavier than :func:`odeint` with ``return_trajectory=False``.

    A fixed-step method interpolates with whatever ``options["interp"]``
    says, and without ``step_size`` its grid is the single interval
    ``[t0, t1]`` — usually far too coarse, so pass one.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import lucid, lucid.diffeq as diffeq
    >>> y0 = lucid.tensor([1.0], dtype=lucid.float64)
    >>> dense = diffeq.odeint_dense(lambda t, y: -y, y0, 0.0, 1.0)

    r"""Integrate from ``t0`` until an event fires.

    The convenience form of ``odeint(..., event_fn=...)`` for the common case
    where there is no output grid at all — you have a starting time and a
    condition, and want to know when the condition is met.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
        Right-hand side ``f(t, y) -> dy/dt``.
    y0 : Tensor
        Initial state at ``t0``.
    t0 : float or Tensor
        Start time.
    event_fn : callable
        ``g(t, y)`` returning a single-element tensor.  The solve ends the
        moment its sign changes; a value of exactly zero at ``t0`` fires
        immediately.
    reverse_time : bool, default=False
        Search backwards in time instead of forwards.
    odeint_interface : callable, default=:func:`odeint`
        Solver to delegate to.  Pass :func:`odeint_adjoint` to get the event
        solve at constant memory.
    **kwargs
        Forwarded to ``odeint_interface`` — ``rtol``, ``atol``, ``method``,
        ``options``.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        ``(event_t, solution)``; ``event_t`` is a 0-D tensor and
        ``solution`` has shape ``(2, *y0.shape)`` — the state at ``t0`` and
        the state at the event.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If a fixed-step method is used without ``options["step_size"]``, or
        if ``event_fn`` does not return a single-element tensor.
    RuntimeError
        If no sign change is found within the step budget.

    Notes
    -----
    The event time itself is located by bisecting the interpolant of the
    step that brackets it, so it costs event-function calls but no extra
    right-hand-side evaluations.

    ``event_t`` is differentiable, though bisection itself is not: the event
    time is pinned by ``g(t*, y(t*)) = 0``, and differentiating that identity
    routes its gradient onto the state at the event, which does carry a graph.
    Expect total derivatives -- the state at the event moves with the event
    time, so differentiating ``solution[-1]`` accounts for that too.

    Examples
    --------
    A body falling from rest hits the ground at :math:`\sqrt{2h/g}`:

    >>> import lucid, lucid.diffeq as diffeq
    >>> y0 = lucid.tensor([10.0, 0.0], dtype=lucid.float64)  # height, velocity
    >>> def fall(t, y):
    ...     return lucid.stack([y[1], lucid.tensor(-9.8, dtype=y.dtype)], dim=0)
    >>> event_t, sol = diffeq.odeint_event(
    ...     fall, y0, 0.0, event_fn=lambda t, y: y[0]
    ... )
    >>> abs(float(event_t.item()) - (2 * 10.0 / 9.8) ** 0.5) < 1e-6
