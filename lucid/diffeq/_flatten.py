"""Packing a group of differently-shaped tensors into one flat state.

An ODE solver integrates a single tensor, but two things want to integrate a
*collection*: the adjoint method, whose augmented state is the solution
alongside its adjoint and one accumulator per parameter, and a caller whose
state is naturally a tuple.  Both reduce to the same trick — concatenate into
one vector, integrate that, split it back.
