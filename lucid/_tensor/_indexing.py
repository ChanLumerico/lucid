Tensor indexing: __getitem__ and __setitem__ with full reference-framework parity.

Supported forms
───────────────
Basic (no autograd break):
  t[int]                   scalar selection (removes dimension)
  t[slice]                 slice selection
  t[Ellipsis]              Ellipsis expansion
  t[None, ...]             None / newaxis → unsqueeze
  t[int, slice, ...]       multi-dimensional basic

Advanced (any Tensor in the index key):
  t[bool_mask_1d]          row-selection where mask is True   → (n_true, *t.shape[1:])
  t[bool_mask_full]        element-selection, mask == t.shape → (n_true,)
  t[int_tensor]            fancy row selection                → (*idx.shape, *t.shape[1:])
  t[int_t0, int_t1, ...]   coordinate selection               → broadcast(*idx_shapes)
  t[slice, int_tensor]     basic prefix + fancy suffix
  t[int_tensor, slice]     fancy prefix + basic suffix
  t[None, int_tensor, ...] None/newaxis anywhere

  t[True] / t[False]       a new leading axis of length 1 / 0     → (1|0, *t.shape)
  t[[0, 2]], t[ndarray]    a list or array is an index tensor

In-place assignment:
  t[key] = value           every form above; the value is broadcast to
                           what ``t[key]`` reads and written there

Two stages own every decision about what a key or a value means, and both
paths — reading and writing — go through them:

* :func:`_normalize_key` turns any key into one :class:`_Key`: ``...``
  expanded, bool scalars turned into a new axis plus an index, masks into
  their coordinates, lists and arrays into index tensors, every index tensor
  on the indexed tensor's device at its own integer width.  Bounds are left
  to the engine, which checks int64 at full width.
* :func:`_normalize_value` turns a value into a tensor of the destination's
  dtype, on its device, at the shape it is written at — a Python scalar
  keeping its kind and precision.

Every write lands through :func:`_rebind`, which keeps what the tensor
carries besides its values (``requires_grad``, ``retain_grad``, a gradient
slot it reads, the views it has).
