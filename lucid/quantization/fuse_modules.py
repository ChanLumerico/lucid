    r"""Collapse Conv/BN/ReLU (or Linear/ReLU) runs into single fused modules.

    ``fuse_modules`` is a pre-processing step you run **before**
    :func:`~lucid.quantization.prepare` in the static-PTQ workflow. It rewrites
    the model so each named run of adjacent layers becomes one module: the first
    member is replaced by the fused module and the rest by
    :class:`~lucid.nn.Identity` (so the model's original ``forward`` still routes
    through them harmlessly). BatchNorm is folded into the preceding convolution's
    weight via the eval-time fusion, and a trailing ReLU is absorbed into an
    ``nn.intrinsic`` fused module.

    Fusion matters for quantization on two counts. First, folding BN into the
    conv weight removes a separately-quantized layer and its rounding error, and
    it means there is only one weight tensor to quantize per block. Second,
    absorbing the ReLU makes the downstream activation observer see the *post-*
    ReLU range, so the calibrated grid is not wasted on the negative half that
    the ReLU would clip anyway — a direct accuracy win. Put the model in ``eval``
    mode first: the BN fold uses the frozen running statistics, which is only
    correct in eval.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : nn.Module
        The model to fuse. Put it in ``eval`` mode first — BN folding is
        eval-time (it consumes the frozen running mean / variance).
    modules_to_fuse : sequence of name groups
        Each group is a list of dotted module names to fuse together, e.g.
        ``[["conv1", "bn1"], ["layer1.0.conv1", "layer1.0.bn1", "layer1.0.relu"]]``.
        Supported runs: ``[Conv, BN]``, ``[Conv, BN, ReLU]``, ``[Conv, ReLU]``,
        and ``[Linear, ReLU]``; any other pattern raises ``ValueError``.
    inplace : bool, default False
        If ``True`` fuse and return ``model`` itself; if ``False`` (default) fuse
        a :func:`copy.deepcopy` and leave the original untouched.

    Returns
    -------
    nn.Module
        The fused model, with each run's first module replaced by the fused
        module and the remaining members turned into ``Identity``.

    Notes
    -----
    - Order-preserving: replacements are spliced in through ``_modules`` rather
      than ``setattr``, so a ``Sequential``'s execution order is unchanged
      (``setattr`` would move a re-added key to the end).
    - The trailing members become ``Identity`` rather than being deleted, so any
      hand-written ``forward`` that still calls them keeps working.
    - This is the **eval / static-PTQ** fusion. For quantization-aware training
      use :func:`fuse_modules_qat`, which keeps Conv+BN trainable and folds BN
      per forward instead of freezing it.
    - Non-destructive by default (deep-copy).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import lucid.nn as nn
    >>> import lucid.quantization as Q
    >>> class Block(nn.Module):

    ...         self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, 8, 3)
    ...         self.bn = nn.BatchNorm2d(8)
    ...         self.relu = nn.ReLU()
    ...     def forward(self, x):
    ...         return self.relu(self.bn(self.conv(x)))
    >>> m = Block().eval()
    >>> fused = Q.fuse_modules(m, [["conv", "bn", "relu"]])
    >>> type(fused.conv).__name__               # Conv+BN+ReLU -> one fused module
    'ConvReLU2d'

def fuse_modules_qat(

    r"""Fuse for **QAT** — Conv+BN runs become trainable ``nn.intrinsic.qat`` modules.

    ``fuse_modules_qat`` is the fusion step of the quantization-aware-training
    workflow, run **before** :func:`~lucid.quantization.prepare_qat`. It mirrors
    :func:`fuse_modules` but keeps BatchNorm *learnable*. Where the eval-time
    :func:`fuse_modules` folds BN into the conv weight once and freezes it — fine
    for a frozen PTQ model — that would stop BN from training, which QAT needs.
    So here a ``[Conv, BN]`` / ``[Conv, BN, ReLU]`` run becomes a trainable
    ``ConvBn*`` / ``ConvBnReLU*`` module that folds BN **per forward**: the BN
    parameters keep updating and the fold is recomputed each step, all under the
    straight-through estimator of the fake-quant grid. ``[Conv, ReLU]`` and
    ``[Linear, ReLU]`` runs (no BN) become the plain ``nn.intrinsic`` fused
    module, which :func:`~lucid.quantization.prepare_qat` then swaps to its QAT
    form.

    Because the trainable ``ConvBn*`` modules fake-quantize at construction time,
    the ``qconfig`` must be supplied *here* rather than later — it is baked into
    the fused module so its weight fake-quant grid is active from the first
    forward. As with :func:`fuse_modules`, the first member of each run is
    replaced by the fused module and the rest become ``Identity``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : nn.Module
        The model to fuse. Kept **trainable** (unlike :func:`fuse_modules`, do
        not put it in eval — BN must keep learning).
    modules_to_fuse : sequence of name groups
        Dotted-name groups exactly as in :func:`fuse_modules` — e.g.
        ``[["conv1", "bn1"], ["layer1.0.conv1", "layer1.0.bn1"]]``. Same supported
        runs: ``[Conv, BN]``, ``[Conv, BN, ReLU]``, ``[Conv, ReLU]``,
        ``[Linear, ReLU]``.
    qconfig : QConfig
        The QAT recipe handed to the fused ``ConvBn*`` modules; they fake-quant
        at construction, so it is needed at fusion time rather than at
        :func:`~lucid.quantization.prepare_qat` time.
    inplace : bool, default False
        If ``True`` fuse and return ``model`` itself; if ``False`` (default) fuse
        a :func:`copy.deepcopy` and leave the original untouched.

    Returns
    -------
    nn.Module
        The fused, still-trainable model — hand it to
        :func:`~lucid.quantization.prepare_qat`, fine-tune, then
        :func:`~lucid.quantization.convert`.

    Notes
    -----
    - Conv+BN stays a single trainable module that folds BN **per forward**; BN
      is never frozen (contrast :func:`fuse_modules`, which folds once at eval).
    - The ``qconfig`` argument is mandatory precisely because the fused
      ``ConvBn*`` fake-quantizes at construction — there is no later hook to pass
      it through.
    - Order-preserving splice via ``_modules``; trailing members become
      ``Identity`` so the original ``forward`` still routes through them.
    - Non-destructive by default (deep-copy).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import lucid.nn as nn
    >>> import lucid.quantization as Q
    >>> class Block(nn.Module):
    ...     def __init__(self):
    ...         super().__init__()
    ...         self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, 8, 3)
    ...         self.bn = nn.BatchNorm2d(8)
    ...     def forward(self, x):
    ...         return self.bn(self.conv(x))
    >>> m = Block()                              # kept in train mode
    >>> qcfg = Q.get_default_qat_qconfig()
    >>> fused = Q.fuse_modules_qat(m, [["conv", "bn"]], qcfg)
    >>> type(fused.conv).__name__               # trainable Conv+BN, folds per forward
    'ConvBn2d'
