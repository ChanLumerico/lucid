"""AMP and quantization on MNIST — verified against what they promise.

The sibling module pins Lucid's training against a reference step for step.
That approach does not transfer here, and it is worth being explicit about
why: both mixed precision and post-training quantization are *lossy by
design*.  Two correct implementations legitimately disagree — they may cast a
different set of ops, pick a different loss scale, or choose different
observer statistics — so a per-step numeric comparison against the reference
would measure implementation choices rather than correctness.

What can be checked is the contract each feature actually offers:

  * **AMP** — training in half precision reaches the same quality as float32,
    without overflowing to NaN.  That is the whole promise; speed is a
    separate concern this test does not measure.
  * **Quantization** — an int8 model stays close to the float model it came
    from, and the accuracy it loses is small.

Both are also checked for *not being no-ops*, which matters more than it
sounds.  An ``autocast`` that silently failed to cast anything, or a
``convert`` that returned the float model untouched, would sail through every
quality assertion above — the numbers would be perfect because nothing
happened.  Those two checks are what make the rest meaningful.
