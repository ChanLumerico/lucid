"""CSPNet parity tests.

All three registered variants have a reference counterpart.  Only
cspresnet_50 was listed here for a long time, and the two that were not
had both drifted: cspdarknet_53 activated at darknet's leaky slope of
0.1 where its checkpoint was trained at 0.01, and cspresnext_50 split
two cross-stages with an activation the checkpoint leaves linear.
Neither could be seen from a load — an activation has no weights — and
neither was ever compared."""
