"""Every registered spec must be reached by some test.

``_registry.py`` is the single source of truth for what the model zoo is
compared against, and reading it that way is the trap: registering a
spec does not run it.  Each test module hand-writes a ``_FACTORIES`` set
and picks the registry entries matching it, so a spec whose factory
nobody listed is registered, counted, and never once compared.

Three were, out of 106.  Two of the three had drifted from the
implementation their weights came from — cspdarknet_53 activating at
darknet's leaky slope of 0.1 against a checkpoint trained at 0.01, and
cspresnext_50 splitting two cross-stages with an activation the
checkpoint leaves linear.  Neither shows up at load time, because an
activation carries no parameters, so nothing in the repository could
have caught them and nothing did; they were found by hand.

The list is maintained by hand and will be edited again, which is the
argument for checking it rather than trusting it.
