"""MNIST training pinned against a reference implementation, step for step.

Every other training test in this repo asserts only that *Lucid's own* loss
shrinks on synthetic data.  That catches a dead gradient, but it cannot catch
a gradient that is merely wrong: a loss curve going down is compatible with an
optimizer that is subtly mis-scaled, a backward that drops a term, or a
convolution whose padding is off by one.  Each of those still "trains", just
to a worse model, and nothing in a solo run reports it.

So this module pins Lucid against a reference implementation on a problem with
a known answer.  For every case both frameworks get the same architecture, the
same initial state (Lucid's parameters *and* buffers, copied across, so step 0
is identical rather than merely similar), the same data in the same order and
the same optimizer settings.  Under those conditions the two are solving an
identical optimisation problem, and any divergence is Lucid's numerics.

Cases
-----

``lenet``   the canonical 61,706-parameter LeNet-5 (LeCun et al. 1998), under
            SGD+momentum, Adam and AdamW.  Three optimizers because SGD's
            update is almost trivially checkable while Adam's is not — bias
            correction, epsilon placement and AdamW's decoupled decay are each
            a place where a plausible implementation is off by a little, and
            "a little" is invisible in a loss curve.
``bn_cnn``  BatchNorm, ReLU and max pooling — the modern convolution block
            LeNet gives no coverage of.
``resnet``  two post-activation residual blocks.  The skip is the point: its
            backward adds the upstream gradient to the branch gradient, so a
            wrong accumulation gives a model that trains but underperforms,
            with the residual path silently contributing nothing.
``vit``     a pre-norm transformer block over 16 image patches — multi-head
            attention, LayerNorm and two more residuals.  LayerNorm differs
            from BatchNorm in that its statistics are computed inside the
            graph and must therefore be differentiated, not just tracked.
``+cosine`` LeNet again with ``CosineAnnealingLR`` driving both sides, which
            checks the schedule itself rather than the optimizer.

Measured behaviour
------------------

Tolerances are set from measurement, not from a guess, and the architectures
split cleanly into two regimes.

Smooth models do not drift at all.  Over all 470 steps, on CPU and Metal::

    lenet (tanh, avgpool)             max 2.4e-07 (SGD) … 1.1e-06 (AdamW)
    lenet + cosine schedule           max 4.8e-07, learning rates bit-equal
    vit (softmax, GELU, LayerNorm)    max 3.6e-07

tanh, softmax, GELU and average pooling are all smooth, so a 1-ULP difference
is damped rather than amplified and the two runs stay on top of each other for
the whole run.  The expectation going in had been the opposite — that float32's
non-associative addition would separate them through reduction order alone.

Models containing ReLU and max pooling do drift, and the reason is
architectural rather than a defect::

    bn_cnn   epoch max  2.2e-04  9.3e-04  2.2e-03  2.6e-03  3.8e-03
    resnet   epoch max  4.4e-04  1.6e-03  2.4e-03  2.2e-03  3.6e-03

ReLU's threshold and MaxPool's argmax are discrete: a 1-ULP difference can
flip which unit is active or which element wins a pooling window, and the
gradient then takes a different path outright.  Several independent checks say
this is amplified rounding — step 0 is *exactly* 0.0 for both, the sign of the
difference is balanced across steps (216 lucid-high vs 250 lucid-low for
bn_cnn, mean signed difference only 19% of mean absolute), and with the
weights frozen the BatchNorm buffers agree to 5.96e-08.

The control experiment settles it.  Run the *reference against itself* with a
single weight nudged by one ULP — same code on both sides, so any divergence
cannot be an implementation difference::

    reference vs 1-ULP-perturbed reference   epoch max  4.5e-04 … 3.5e-03
    lucid vs reference                       epoch max  2.2e-04 … 3.8e-03

The same magnitude.  And over the early window Lucid tracks the reference
*more* closely (1.2e-05) than the reference tracks a one-ULP copy of itself
(1.0e-04).  The drift belongs to the architecture; any two correct
implementations would show it.

Why the early window carries the test
-------------------------------------

A real defect is present from the first step while chaotic drift needs epochs,
so the tight bound applies to the first 30 steps and a coarse one to the whole
run.  Verified by injection — a 1% learning-rate error, the "trains fine,
converges to a slightly worse model" defect this module exists to catch::

    case          clean max[:30]   with 1% error   final accuracy difference
    lenet-sgd     4.8e-07          8.8e-03         0.0005   (not caught)
    bn_cnn-adam   1.2e-05          7.7e-03         0.0000   (not caught)
    resnet-adam   7.5e-05          9.0e-03         0.0005   (not caught)
    vit-adam      2.4e-07          4.0e-03         0.0025   (not caught)

Only the step-level check fires; the accuracy comparison misses the defect in
every single case, so it cannot carry the test.  An epoch-and-accuracy-only
version of this module passes a mis-scaled optimizer without complaint, which
is exactly the failure it was written to detect.  The bounds put the detection
floor near a 0.1% error in both regimes.

Scope: 6,000 training images rather than the full 60,000, so each case runs in
roughly 20 seconds per device.
