"""Measure which scales the reference framework answers finitely at.

The stability axis feeds each op an input scaled across fourteen orders
of magnitude and reports a NaN as a defect.  Its premise — "a finite,
in-domain input must not produce a NaN" — carries the whole check in the
words *in domain*, and the axis had no way to know where that was.

So it reported ``acos`` for answering NaN at 1e+6.  ``acos`` is defined
on [-1, 1]; NaN is the only answer it *can* give there, and the same is
true of ``asin``, ``atanh``, ``logit``, ``erfinv`` and ``acosh``.  Ten of
the twenty-six findings were the op being right.

The domain cannot be derived from the op — it is a mathematical fact
about the function, not a property of the code — and hand-listing it is
how the dtype table went wrong before it was measured.  So it is
measured here the same way: the audit's own probe, at the audit's own
scales, replayed against the reference.  A NaN Lucid produces where the
reference produces a number is a defect; a NaN they both produce is the
function's domain.

Run::

    python -m lucid.test.audit.tools.stability_contract

The result is checked in as ``stability_contract.json`` so the audit
reads it without the reference installed.
