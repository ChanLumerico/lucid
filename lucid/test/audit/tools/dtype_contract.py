"""Measure which dtypes the reference framework accepts, per symbol.

The dtype axis compares cpu against metal.  That answers *whether* the
two devices agree and never *which one is right* — and deciding that by
eye was going badly.  ``avg_pool2d`` looks obviously float-only and takes
int64; ``sigmoid`` looks obviously float-only and accepts every integer,
promoting on the way out; ``argsort`` takes bool and ``argmax`` does not.
None of that is guessable from the name, and a wrong guess widens a gate
that should have been narrowed — which is worse than the asymmetry it
was fixing, because a wrong answer is now returned on both devices.

So the third opinion is measured.  For each symbol the audit surveys,
this replays *the audit's own invocation* against the reference at each
dtype and records what survives.  Replaying the same call is the point:
if the two built their arguments differently the comparison would be
between two different questions and the table would be evidence for
nothing.  Both sides go through :func:`_probe.dtype_args`.

Run::

    python -m lucid.test.audit.tools.dtype_contract

The result is checked in as ``dtype_contract.json`` so the audit can read
it without the reference installed.  Symbols the reference has no
counterpart for — Lucid-only ops, and anything whose invocation cannot be
translated — are listed under ``unmapped`` rather than silently omitted,
so a missing verdict is visibly a gap and not a claim.
