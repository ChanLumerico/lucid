"""Axes for the subsystems the numeric sweep cannot express.

``distributions``, ``diffeq``, ``quantization``, ``serialization`` and
``compile`` were enumerated in the denominator and had **no axis at
all** — 141 symbols counted and never checked, which is the exact shape
of the dishonesty this tool exists to remove.  Each gets the question
that is actually meaningful for it:

    distributions   does log_prob agree with the samples, is cdf monotone,
                    does icdf invert it
    diffeq          does halving the step reduce the error like h**p
    quantization    does quantize -> dequantize land inside one step
    serialization   does a tensor survive a round trip through disk
    compile         does the compiled function agree with the eager one

and :class:`SmokeAxis` catches everything left over, including the
stateful symbols every other axis refuses to touch — those run inside a
guard that snapshots and restores the global state, so they are checked
rather than merely counted.
