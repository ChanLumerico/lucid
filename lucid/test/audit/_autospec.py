"""Deriving the invocation from the signature instead of writing it out.

:mod:`~lucid.test.audit._specs` is a hand-written ladder: a family
pattern per group of ops, and a generic ``f(x)`` / ``f(x, y)`` floor for
everything else.  446 of 827 callable symbols reached only that floor,
which is fine for a plain unary op and useless for anything taking a
second required argument of a shape the floor cannot guess.  Those became
SKIP — counted honestly, and still not verified.

That is the same failure mode as the module list which held the audit's
reach at 73.8%: a hand-maintained enumeration of something the
interpreter already knows.  A signature is machine-readable, so read it.
With this module the figure is 825 of 827; the two left take no arguments
at all, and calling them with none is what the smoke axis already does.

    def conv2d(input, weight, bias=None, stride=1, ...)
              ^tensor ^tensor  ^skipped, it has a default

Three rules, in order of how much they know:

1.  **Relations** — a parameter whose value depends on one already
    chosen.  ``weight`` has to agree with ``input`` on channels, a
    class-index ``target`` has to be bounded by the logits' width.  This
    is the only part that encodes semantics, and it is a dozen entries
    rather than one per op.
2.  **Name** — ``dim``, ``eps``, ``groups``, ``kernel_size``.  A name
    says more than ``int`` does.
3.  **Annotation text** — the fallback: ``Tensor``, ``bool``,
    ``tuple[int, int]``, ``Literal["mean", "sum"]``.

Only parameters *without* a default are filled.  A default is the
author's own statement of a value that works, and overriding it would
test this module's opinion rather than the op.

Annotations are read with ``Format.STRING``.  Lucid puts tensor types in
a ``TYPE_CHECKING`` block and leaves the annotation bare (H1 / H7 plus
PEP 649), so resolving them raises ``NameError`` for a large part of the
framework — the unevaluated text is both sufficient and always available.
