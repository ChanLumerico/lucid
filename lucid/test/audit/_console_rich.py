"""A live per-subsystem display, when ``rich`` is installed.

The stdlib console in :mod:`~lucid.test.audit._console` shows one bar at
a time, for the axis currently running.  That is the wrong axis of the
work to watch: a sweep is 27 axes over 34 subsystems, and what a person
wants to know part-way through is *which package is being hammered and
how it is doing*, not which of 27 questions is currently being asked.

This module renders instead:

* one overall bar over every (symbol x axis) cell, with elapsed and ETA;
* one bar per subsystem, each with its own running pass / fail / skip,
  as many as the terminal is tall enough to hold;
* a footer naming the axis and symbol in flight, and the running defect
  count.

Nothing else is written while the sweep runs.  A live region can only be
redrawn in place, so anything printed into it pushes it down the screen,
and a display that jumps every time a defect is found is worse at
conveying "9 defects so far" than a number that counts up.  The findings
themselves are listed in full when the run ends, where the whole list can
be read at once; the per-subsystem totals are reprinted there too, as
static lines, so the bars that did not fit on screen are still accounted
for.

``rich`` is optional.  :func:`build` returns ``None`` when it is not
installed, when the output is redirected, or under ``--quiet`` /
``--no-color``, and the caller keeps the stdlib display — the audit has
never needed a third-party package to run and still does not.

Install it with ``pip install lucid-dl[audit]``.
