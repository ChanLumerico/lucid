"""Input construction: domains, probes and the numeric helpers.

Two things here are load-bearing.

**Domains.**  Ops are defined on different sets, and guessing per-op by
name is its own source of error, so a check tries a ladder of domains and
keeps the first on which the forward and backward passes are both finite.
The ladder deliberately avoids sampling near a pole: a draw that lands on
``x = 6e-4`` makes ``1/x`` and ``psi`` disagree with central differences
at 1e-4 for reasons that have nothing to do with either op.

**Seeds.**  Outputs are contracted against a *fixed random* covector,
never ``ones``.  A constant seed makes softmax's gradient identically
zero, so a finite-difference check passes while testing nothing — the
failure mode the VACUOUS status exists to name.
