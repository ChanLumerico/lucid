# `lucid-audit` — the whole diagnosis, one command

Four stages, one verdict, one exit code.

| stage | asks | catches |
|---|---|---|
| **self-check** | can the instruments still go red? | 30 mutants over 29 of 33 axes |
| **sweep** | does each reachable symbol keep its contract? | 1,512 symbols × 33 axes = 10,800+ cells |
| **suite** | are the specific values the right values? | `pytest lucid/test` + a line-coverage floor |
| **doctests** | does the documentation run? | 5,499 examples + a per-module floor |

They fail independently, and none is a substitute for another.

The self-check runs **first**, on a clean interpreter, and the order is
load-bearing: run after the sweep, four mutants stopped being caught,
because the sweep leaves device and module state behind. An instrument
check the run itself perturbs proves nothing.

Measured on one session's defects: the sweep found the gradient that was
never wired and the sampler drawing at the wrong concentration; the
suite found the assignment writing a rectangle instead of a diagonal,
the histogram binning onto the wrong grid, the transform whose inverse
was NaN, and the window that deleted its own frame. A gate that runs
only one of them reports "clean" over half a framework.

```bash
lucid-audit                 # every stage, one verdict     (~15 min)
lucid-audit --audit-only    # self-check + sweep
lucid-audit --tests-only    # suite + line coverage + doctests
lucid-audit --self-check    # the instruments alone, seconds
```

```
── verdict ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  blind axes                      0
  audit defects                   0
  audit coverage regressions      0
  suite failures                  0
  line coverage regressions       0
  docstring regressions           0

  clean on every stage that ran
```

Exit is `0` only when every stage that ran is clean, so this works as a
gate without reading the output. `2` means the harness itself broke —
distinct from `1`, which means the framework did.

### Why the suite runs in a subprocess

By the time the sweep is done the audit has imported the whole package
and, on some axes, patched parts of it. Collecting the suite into that
interpreter would let one stage's state decide the other stage's result,
which is the one thing a gate made of two independent checks must not
allow.

### Why line coverage is measured by default

Because it is free. The suite takes 9m09s uninstrumented and 8m29s under
`coverage` — the wall clock is MLX and Accelerate, not Python line
tracing. A floor that costs nothing to check should be checked on every
run rather than remembered. `--no-line-coverage` turns it off anyway.

The floor lives in `suite.json` and is compared per module, with a
2-point tolerance and a 20-statement minimum: adding statements to a
well-covered file lowers its percentage honestly, and a gate that fires
on that is a gate people learn to ignore. Record a new floor
deliberately:

```bash
lucid-audit --tests-only --update-suite
```

---

## Setup on a fresh machine

From the **repository root** (the directory holding `pyproject.toml`):

```bash
cd /path/to/lucid

# 1. Build the engine and install the package.
#    ⚠️ `uv pip`, never plain `pip` — .venv has no pip, so `pip` leaks to
#    the system pip3 and bakes that interpreter's absolute rpath into the
#    .so. See [[debug-build-wrong-venv-rpath]].
VIRTUAL_ENV=.venv MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=26.0 \
    uv pip install -e ".[audit]" --no-build-isolation

# 2. Confirm the engine linked against *this* venv.
otool -l lucid/_C/engine.cpython-314-darwin.so | grep -A2 LC_RPATH | grep path

# 3. Confirm the tool is on PATH and the surface enumerates.
lucid-audit --coverage
```

`--coverage` runs no probes at all — it walks the package and prints what
the sweep *can* reach. It is the fastest way to tell a working install
from a broken one.

### What the `[audit]` extra adds

`rich`, `coverage` and `pytest`. `rich` buys the live per-subsystem
display and nothing else — without it the sweep runs identically on a
stdlib ANSI console, because a correctness tool should not fail to start
over a presentation dependency. `coverage` backs the line-coverage floor
and `pytest` runs the suite stage; without either, that stage degrades
rather than fails: it says what is missing and the sweep still reports.

### If `lucid-audit` is not found

The console script is registered at install time, so it appears only
after step 1. Until then — and always, as a fallback — this is the same
program:

```bash
python -m lucid.test.audit --coverage
```

### Requirements

Inherited from Lucid itself: macOS 26+ on Apple Silicon, Python 3.14,
MLX ≥ 0.31. There is nothing the audit needs beyond what building the
engine already needs.

## Running it

```bash
lucid-audit                      # everything; minutes
lucid-audit --quick              # fewer domains, smaller probes
lucid-audit --json report.json   # machine-readable, with every SKIP reason
lucid-audit --fail-fast          # stop at the first defect
```

Scoping, when you are working on one area:

```bash
lucid-audit --subsystem nn.functional
lucid-audit --subsystem linalg,fft --axis grad,grad2
lucid-audit --select 'conv|pool'
```

Exit status is `0` when no defect survived, `1` when one did, `2` when
the harness itself broke.

### Through pytest

Every cell is also a collectable pytest case, deselected by default
because the sweep takes minutes:

```bash
pytest lucid/test/ -m audit
pytest lucid/test/audit/test_audit_smoke.py    # the harness's own tests, ~1s
```

## Reading the output

```
⠙ overall ━━━━━╺━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  230/10841  16% 0:00:12 eta 0:04:31

  lucid         ━━━━━━╺━━━━━━━━━━ 230/807    221 ok     9 –

```

One bar per subsystem, each with its own running counts. Defects print
above the live region as they are found.

### Statuses

| | |
|---|---|
| `PASS` | the axis's question was asked and answered correctly |
| `FAIL` | a defect |
| `TRNC` | the finite-difference probe was the limit, not the op — the disagreement shrank like `h²` when the step was refined |
| `GAUG` | correct only up to a symmetry (sign of an eigenvector, phase of an FFT, the constant a softmax is invariant to) |
| `VAC` | the check ran but could not have failed — reported separately because a vacuous pass reads as coverage and is not |
| `UNSP` | the op refused, loudly and by design |
| `SKIP` | **the harness could not build inputs.** Not "no problem" — "not checked" |
| `KNWN` | a defect accepted in `known.json` |

### Proving an axis can fail

```bash
lucid-audit --self-check
```

Breaks the framework on purpose, once per axis, in exactly the way that
axis exists to notice — a gradient that is not the derivative, a NaN that
gets swallowed, a handle whose `remove` does not remove — and reports
whether the axis said so. 30 mutants, 29 of 33 axes; the four with no
mutant are printed as **unproven**, each with the reason it cannot be
written — "nobody got to it" and "it cannot be done" are different
facts and only the second is a finding.

It is not decoration. Three findings so far, all about this tool rather
than the framework:

* `broadcast` compared output *shapes* and never values, so an op that
  broadcast to the right extent and computed the wrong numbers passed all
  nine directions;
* the tokenizer round trip passed a decoder that silently dropped a
  character, on the grounds that dropping it was at least repeatable;
* `layout` **cannot fail at all**. It compares a packed operand against a
  strided view, and this engine materialises every view — `t[..., ::2]`,
  `T`, `expand`, `broadcast_to`, `diagonal` and `unfold` all come back
  packed — so the two operands are byte-identical. 688 cells per run were
  reporting agreement between an op and itself. The axis now says so.

`SKIP` is the number to watch. The summary's *applicable cells* line
reports how many cells produced a verdict at all, and that is the honest
measure of what a run actually checked.

### `SKIP` is not `NOT_APPLICABLE`

They were conflated, and it cost the SKIP list its meaning. "The scale
sweep found no float output" is not a gap — `argmax` returns integers and
a scale sweep has nothing to measure on it. Nor is "the op takes a module
and returns a module": `nn.utils.weight_norm` is checked, thoroughly, by
the `nnutils` axis. Filing either under SKIP put ~500 cells into a work
queue that was already done, and buried the ones that were not.

The rule is the axis's *question*, not its outcome:

* the question cannot be asked here → `NOT_APPLICABLE`, and the cell
  leaves the denominator;
* the question applies and the harness could not set it up → `SKIP`, and
  it stays in the denominator as a debt.

### `UNSUPPORTED` is a claim about the op, so check it is one

`UNSP` reads as "the op refused, loudly and by design", and 318 cells
were making that claim about refusals the *probe* had provoked: a float64
tensor handed to the `fft` family, which accepts only `F16/F32/C64`; a
`Tensor` handed to `pad_packed_sequence`, which wants a `PackedSequence`;
and 135 cells where the axis read `.grad.numpy()` on a `None` and
reported its own `AttributeError`. The substitution now keeps the
original argument's dtype, the axes name a missing gradient as a missing
gradient, and a non-tensor output is `NOT_APPLICABLE` rather than a
refusal — 318 down to **zero**.

---

## The three coverage numbers

They fail independently and are routinely conflated:

| | meaning |
|---|---|
| **reach** | fraction of public objects the surface enumerates. Checked against `independent_walk()`, which shares none of the enumeration's logic. Currently 100%. |
| **depth** | fraction of symbols with an axis that can actually fail, rather than only the smoke axis. |
| **verdict** | fraction of cells that answer rather than SKIP. **Only a real run knows this**, and it is well below the other two. Currently 75.7%, over 1,476 of 1,512 symbols. It *fell* from 81.7% when `--self-check` showed the layout axis could not fail: 688 cells moved from PASS to VACUOUS, and the lower number is the true one. |

"Mutating process state" is not a reason to stop, and was used as one for
79 symbols. Mutating state is what makes them checkable: seed twice and
the draws must match, set a default and a new tensor must follow it,
register a hook and it must fire — then `remove()` and it must stop.
That is the `state` and `hook` axes, and none of it is a numeric
comparison.

Reaching a symbol is not verifying it, and `depth` is an upper bound, not
a result. Quote the verdict rate from `--json` when you want to say how
much of the framework a run actually checked.

---

## Did my change break something?

An absolute count cannot answer that. An op that stops being reachable
moves one cell from `pass` to `unsupported` among fifteen hundred
already-unsupported ones, and nothing in the summary changes visibly.

So every run is diffed against `coverage.json`, which records which
`(axis, symbol)` cells produce a verdict:

```bash
lucid-audit                 # runs, then reports what moved
```

```
── coverage regressions · 1 ──────────────────────────────
  LOST  grad::lucid.expm1  (was pass, now unanswered)
```

The exit code is non-zero for a regression as well as for a defect, so
this works as a gate without reading the output. A cell that used to
answer and no longer does is the interesting direction: the op is still
exported, the audit simply cannot reach it any more — which is what a
refactor breaks without breaking a test.

Newly answered cells are reported too, as progress rather than failure.
When the new state is the intended one:

```bash
lucid-audit --update-coverage
```

Do that deliberately. Re-recording to make a red run go green silences
exactly the signal the file exists for.

Only verdicts are recorded. `SKIP` and `UNSUPPORTED` carry probe details
that move for reasons unrelated to the framework, and a baseline that
churns is a baseline nobody re-reads.

`--no-coverage-diff` turns the comparison off.

> `coverage.json` answers "is this still reachable". `known.json` answers
> "is this failure accepted". A failing cell belongs in the second; a cell
> that stopped being asked belongs in neither — fix it or record it as the
> new floor on purpose.

---

## Extending it

**A symbol is skipped.** Read the reason in the report. If the block is a
required parameter the derivation has no value for, add one entry to
`_autospec._BY_NAME` — that closes it for every other op spelling the
parameter the same way. Writing a per-op spec in `_specs.py` is the last
resort, not the first.

**A whole subsystem is thin.** `--coverage` prints per-subsystem depth. A
low number there means the symbols need an axis, not a spec — see
`_axes_data.py` for the shape of one.

**A scoped run crashes and the full one does not.** That is not a
selection bug. `--axis grad,grad2` SIGBUSes about three runs in five,
inside LAPACK, reached from `lucid.linalg.ldl_solve`; the full sweep
dies about one run in eight, and `ldl_solve` on its own survives 120 consecutive runs of the
same axis. An out-of-bounds *write* elsewhere lands harmlessly when the
other axes have already shaped the heap. Three such writes have been
found and closed at the probe end — `ctc_loss` reading past `targets`,
`lu_solve` reading past a flat `pivots`, `LPPool1d` unfolding a rank-2
input — and at least one remains unlocated. When a run dies, re-run
under `-X faulthandler` and bisect by axis, not by symbol: the symbol it
dies in is the victim, not the cause.

**A finding looks wrong.** Check the harness before the framework. Of the
first twelve failures the newest axes reported, twelve were the
instrument: an abstract base raising `NotImplementedError` by contract, a
word-level tokenizer handed a vocabulary of single letters, a regex
parameter filled with the literal `"constant"`, a scheduler resumed
without restoring the optimizer it drives.
