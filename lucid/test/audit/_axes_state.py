"""Axes for the symbols that answer about state rather than about numbers.

Ninety-six symbols reached only :class:`~lucid.test.audit._axes_subsystem.
SmokeAxis` — called once, required not to crash, and asked nothing else.
Seventy-nine of them were excused on the grounds that they "mutate process
state and no numeric axis can express them", which is true and is not a
reason to stop.  *Mutating* state is exactly what makes them checkable:

    manual_seed(0); a = rand(); manual_seed(0); b = rand()   a must equal b
    set_default_dtype(float64)                               zeros(2) must follow
    set_grad_enabled(False)                                  x * x must have no graph
    get_rng_state() / set_rng_state()                        must restore the draw

None of those is a numeric comparison and every one of them can fail.  A
setter whose getter does not see it, a seed that does not reproduce, a
hook that is registered and never fires, a handle whose ``remove`` leaves
the hook installed — these are the defects this file exists for, and the
smoke axis passes all of them because the call itself does not raise.

Five axes, each over a group the numeric sweep cannot reach:

    state       global get/set pairs, seeds, thread counts, grad mode
    hook        the module and tensor hook registrars, and their handles
    metadata    dtype and device algebra: promote_types, finfo, .itemsize
    transform   the functional transforms: grad, vmap, jacrev, vjp, checkpoint
    nnutils     parametrize / prune / weight_norm / fuse, which take a module

    """The weights registry: what is registered comes back, by every route.

    Seven symbols with no axis at all, because the obvious check needs
    the network and the obvious data needs ``lucid.models`` — which this
    tool excludes, so the registry is *empty* in the audit's process and
    every lookup correctly answers ``None``.

    Registering a synthetic architecture removes both problems.  The
    contract is then fully checkable offline and it is not a small one:
    four public functions read the same table by four different keys,
    and a registry where ``weights_for`` finds an entry that
    ``get_weight`` cannot name is broken in a way no single lookup
    reveals.
