"""Verdicts, findings and the report the audit produces.

The status vocabulary is the part worth reading.  A survey that only
knows PASS and FAIL over-reports: most of what a first pass flags is an
artefact of the probe rather than a defect in the code, and a tool that
cannot say so trains its user to ignore it.

    PASS         checked and correct
    FAIL         checked and wrong — the only status that is a defect
    TRUNCATION   the finite-difference probe was the limiting factor, not
                 the op; proved by refining the step and watching the
                 disagreement shrink quadratically
    GAUGE        the quantity is only defined up to a symmetry (SVD's
                 singular vectors), so a difference means nothing
    VACUOUS      the check ran but could not have failed — a gradient
                 that is identically zero, a mask with no live entries.
                 Reported separately because a vacuous pass is worse
                 than no pass: it reads as coverage and is not
    UNSUPPORTED  the op refused, loudly and by design (no graph formula,
                 dtype not implemented).  A limitation, not a defect
    SKIP         the harness could not build inputs.  **Counted and
                 listed**, because this is exactly where a census
                 quietly stops being one
    KNOWN        matches an accepted entry in the baseline file
    ERROR        the probe itself broke
