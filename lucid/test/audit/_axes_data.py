"""Axes for the four subsystems that are classes rather than functions.

``utils.transforms`` (97 symbols), ``utils.data`` (25),
``utils.tokenizer`` (20) and ``optim.lr_scheduler`` (16) were reached by
the surface and then hit only by :class:`~lucid.test.audit.
_axes_subsystem.SmokeAxis` — constructed and called once, which for a
class with a lifecycle is barely a check at all.  158 symbols, a tenth
of the framework, verified to the depth of "it did not raise".

Each gets the question that can actually fail for it:

    transform    does applying it return a finite tensor, leave the input
                 alone, and repeat under a fixed seed
    data         does the dataset / sampler / loader / collator triple of
                 length, indexing and iteration agree with each other
    tokenizer    does ``decode(encode(text))`` give the text back
    scheduler    do the learning rates stay finite and does a state_dict
                 round trip resume the same schedule

The shared difficulty is construction: ``Resize`` wants ``height`` and
``width``, ``BPETokenizer`` wants a vocabulary and a merge list, every
scheduler wants a live optimizer.  :func:`_construct` reads the
signature and fills what it recognises, so adding a class to any of
these packages does not mean editing this file.
