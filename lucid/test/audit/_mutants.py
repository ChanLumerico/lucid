"""Proving the axes can go red.

A green axis is not evidence.  It becomes evidence only once the axis has
been shown to produce a red light for the defect it claims to catch —
otherwise "0 defects" and "0 questions asked" print identically, and this
tool's whole output is the first of those two sentences.

The method is mutation.  Each axis gets a symbol that is *deliberately
broken in exactly the way that axis exists to notice*, and the axis has
to report it:

    grad        an op whose analytic gradient is not its derivative
    nonfinite   an op that swallows a NaN
    edge        an op that invents data from an empty input
    device      an op that answers differently on the two backends
    serialize   a round trip that loses values
    hook        a handle whose ``remove`` does not remove

Run it::

    lucid-audit --self-check

An axis with no mutant is reported as **unproven** rather than quietly
omitted — the same rule the sweep applies to itself.  Unproven is not a
failure; it is the honest statement that nobody has shown this axis can
fail, and it is the work queue for the next person who wants to trust it.

The mutants live here rather than in a test because the question they
answer is one the tool should be able to answer *about itself* on demand,
on the machine it is running on.  A test that only runs in CI proves the
axes could fail somewhere else.
