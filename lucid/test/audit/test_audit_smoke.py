"""The audit harness has to work, so it gets its own tests.

Deliberately not the full sweep — that is minutes long and its output is
a report rather than an assertion.  What is checked here is that the
machinery cannot rot silently: the surface enumerates, every axis runs
without raising, the statuses mean what the summary claims, and the two
discriminators that keep the FAIL list short still discriminate.

The last point matters most.  Without the truncation check a
finite-difference probe near a pole reports a defect in ``reciprocal``,
and without the vacuity check a softmax contracted against ``ones``
reports a pass having tested nothing.  Both have happened.
