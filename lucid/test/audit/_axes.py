"""The checks.

Each axis is one question asked of one symbol.  The questions were not
chosen abstractly — every one of them has already caught a defect in this
framework, and the note on each class says which.

Three habits are built into the base rather than left to each axis:

* **the instrument is guarded** — a check that cannot fail is reported
  VACUOUS, not PASS, because a vacuous pass reads as coverage and is not;
* **a disagreement is interrogated before it is reported** — a
  finite-difference probe near a pole disagrees for reasons that have
  nothing to do with the op, so a first FAIL is re-run at a finer step and
  reclassified TRUNCATION if it shrinks quadratically;
* **two spellings beat one hand-derivation** — where an op has another
  route to the same answer, that is the reference, because a hand-written
  expected value encodes a convention the framework is free to choose
  differently (``hardtanh`` at its own clamp boundary).
