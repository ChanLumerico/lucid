"""The whole audit, as collectable pytest cases — one per (symbol, axis).

The sweep is 9,134 atomic verdicts, but until this file existed they only
came into being when someone ran the CLI; ``pytest`` collected 37 tests
from this package and none of them was an actual check of the framework.
A suite that reports only through its own front end is not integrated
with anything.

So every pair is a real test case with a readable id::

    pytest -m audit                              # all 9,134
    pytest -m audit -k 'grad and conv'           # the ones you care about
    pytest -m audit -k 'nonfinite'               # one axis
    pytest lucid/test/audit -m audit --tb=line   # the whole sweep, terse

Opt-in on purpose.  ``addopts`` excludes the ``audit`` marker so a plain
``pytest`` stays the fast suite; the sweep is minutes, not seconds, and
its value is in being run deliberately.

**pytest's own summary is the coverage report.**  A pair the harness
cannot build inputs for calls ``pytest.skip`` with the reason, and an op
that refuses by design skips too — so ``N passed, M skipped`` is exactly
the reach-versus-depth split the CLI prints, without a second mechanism
to keep in agreement.
