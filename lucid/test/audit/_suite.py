"""The test suite as a stage of the audit rather than a separate errand.

The audit walks the package and asks whether each reachable symbol keeps
its contract.  The suite asks whether specific values are the right
values.  They fail independently — and this session's evidence is that
most defects are only visible to one of them:

* the sweep found the gradient that was never wired and the sampler
  drawing at the wrong concentration;
* the suite found the assignment writing a rectangle instead of a
  diagonal, the histogram binning onto the wrong grid, the transform
  whose inverse was NaN, and the window that deleted its own frame.

So a gate that runs only one of them reports "clean" while half the
framework is unchecked.  This module runs the other half and folds its
result into the same verdict, which is what makes ``lucid-audit`` a
single command rather than the first of two.

Line coverage rides along because it costs nothing: the suite takes
9m09s uninstrumented and 8m29s under ``coverage`` — the wall clock is
MLX and Accelerate, not Python line tracing.  A floor that is free to
check should be checked on every run rather than remembered.
