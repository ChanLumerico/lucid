"""Keep the suite inside the memory the machine actually has.

Why this exists
---------------
The full suite was being killed with ``SIGKILL`` partway through the
model zoo — ``pytest exited -9`` after two to seven minutes, with no
traceback and no failing test, because the killer is macOS jetsam rather
than anything in the process.  Measured on a 16 GB M1 Pro, per test:

===============================  ==========  ============  ==========
                                   RSS peak    MLX cache      total
===============================  ==========  ============  ==========
model zoo, as it was                2057 MB       1582 MB     3639 MB
same tests, reclaiming as it goes   2385 MB          0 MB     2385 MB
===============================  ==========  ============  ==========

Two things that table says.  First, the single largest consumer is not
any model — it is MLX's buffer cache, which grows without bound and is
*entirely* reclaimable, so a third of the footprint can be handed back
for free.  Second, what remains is still 2.4 GB, and on a machine whose
swap was already 6.7 GB into its 8 GB the suite is the fattest target in
the room whatever it does.  So reclaiming is necessary and not
sufficient, and the governor does both jobs in that order:

1. hand memory back when the cache has grown past ``reclaim_at``;
2. only if the machine is *still* short, skip the next test rather than
   let jetsam pick the victim.

Order matters.  Skipping first would drop coverage to save memory that
was free for the asking.

Nothing here is silent.  A run that skipped tests says so in the summary
and names them: a suite that quietly shrinks under load reports "all
passed" for a run that checked less than the last one, which is the one
failure mode worse than being killed.

Knobs, all via the environment:

``LUCID_TEST_MEM_GOVERNOR=0``     turn the whole thing off.
``LUCID_TEST_MEM_FLOOR_MB``       skip below this much available memory
                                  (default 1024).  ``0`` disables
                                  skipping but keeps reclaiming.
``LUCID_TEST_MEM_RECLAIM_MB``     reclaim once the cache passes this
                                  (default 256).
