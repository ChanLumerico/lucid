"""Device fixtures — drives CPU/Metal cross-validation.

The default ``device`` fixture parametrizes every requesting test over
the available compute streams.  Metal is detected by attempting a
zero-cost allocation and left out at parametrize time when unavailable.

Metal cannot hold every dtype: MLX has no double precision, so the
engine refuses ``float64`` and ``complex128`` on the GPU stream.  Those
pairs are never generated.  :func:`pytest_generate_tests` sweeps
``device`` together with a dtype fixture and leaves them out, and
:func:`device_dtype_params` / :func:`devices_supporting` do the same for
a test that parametrizes by hand.  What Metal does with the refused
dtypes is asserted once, in
``lucid/test/unit/device/test_metal_dtype_support.py``.
