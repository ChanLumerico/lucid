"""Regression tests: the in-place activations dropped their own derivative.

Found 2026-08-02 by sweeping every differentiable op's analytic gradient
against central finite differences in float64.

All seven ``F.*_`` variants ended in ``x.copy_(f(x))``, and
:meth:`Tensor.copy_` documents that it does **not** extend the autograd
graph.  The values were right and the gradients were not: the returned
tensor kept whatever ``grad_fn`` ``x`` already carried, so the backward
pass behaved as though no activation had been applied.  ``F.elu_`` on
``[-1, 0.5, 2]`` returned ``[1, 1, 1]`` where ELU's derivative is
``[0.368, 1, 1]``.

Nothing inside Lucid calls these — ``nn.ReLU(inplace=True)`` forwards to
the out-of-place ``relu``, and the ``inplace=`` flag on the out-of-place
functions is accepted and ignored — so the reach was user code, silently.

The invariant asserted here is deliberately **not** a hand-derived
derivative: it is that the in-place form agrees with the out-of-place
form.  Writing the derivatives out by hand is how the first version of
this check "failed" ``hardtanh_`` at ``x = min_val``, where Lucid's
choice of one-sided convention is its own and is consistent between the
two spellings.
