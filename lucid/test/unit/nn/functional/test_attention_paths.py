"""The two ``scaled_dot_product_attention`` branches nothing exercised.

Both are recent corrections, and both shipped without a test — which is
how the line-coverage floor caught them rather than the suite.

* ``dropout_p > 0`` takes an explicit-math path instead of the fused
  kernel, because MLX's fused SDPA has no dropout argument.  Before that
  branch existed the argument was accepted and discarded, so every caller
  that asked for attention dropout — BERT among them — trained with none.
  A test that only checks shapes would have passed then too, so these
  check that the probabilities are *actually* dropped, that the
  expectation is preserved, and that the branch still honours
  ``is_causal`` and the additive mask, both of which it re-implements by
  hand rather than delegating.

  Writing these turned up a third thing: the two paths disagreed about
  what a *boolean* mask means.  The fused kernel read ``True`` as "mask
  this out", the dropout branch as "this attends", so every boolean mask
  in a model inverted the moment dropout was switched on.  The function
  now converts a bool mask to its additive form once, up front, and the
  tests below pin both the convention and the agreement.

* A mask that broadcasts over the batch is expanded on the CPU path.  The
  fused kernel accepts only a full or per-batch mask, so a ``(Lq, Lk)``
  mask against a batched query has to be materialised first.
