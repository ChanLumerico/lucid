"""Attention takes the same shapes on Metal as on the CPU.

Metal's fused attention accepts (B, H, L, D) only, and a (B, L, D) query —
what MobileNet-v4's hybrid attention passes — raised "expected to be rank
4" there while the CPU answered.  Both hybrid checkpoints failed on Metal
the first time anything ran them at a batch through their published
weights (the pretrained-accuracy sweep).  The functional folds any other
rank into four axes and back; this holds the two devices to the same
answer and the same gradient at every rank it folds.
