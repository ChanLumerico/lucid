"""A normalisation's accuracy must not depend on how much it reduces.

``group_norm`` and ``batch_norm`` sum a whole group — channels times
spatial, or batch times spatial — to get a mean and a variance.  Done
serially in one ``float``, that sum loses accuracy in proportion to how
many terms it has taken, so the *same layer on the same distribution*
gets worse as the feature map grows: measured 7.8e-07 over four thousand
elements and 2.1e-04 over a million.

That is the shape of the bug, and the shape is what these tests check.
An absolute threshold would not have caught it — 2.1e-04 looks like
float32 accumulation over a deep network, and in the case that found it
(a converted Stable Diffusion autoencoder) it was recorded as exactly
that and left alone for a release.  What gave it away was that the
number *moved with the input's resolution*, so the property pinned here
is flatness rather than any particular value.

Float64 is the reference, not another framework: the question is whether
the f32 path agrees with the same arithmetic carried out precisely, and
Lucid can answer that itself.
