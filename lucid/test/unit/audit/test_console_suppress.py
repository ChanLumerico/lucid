"""``Suppress`` has to silence the descriptors, not just the Python names.

Rebinding ``sys.stdout`` and ``sys.stderr`` silences Python and nothing
else.  The libraries underneath write to file descriptors 1 and 2
directly and never look at either name, so three of them wrote straight
through it and into the middle of a live-progress frame:

    ** On entry to DGESDD, parameter number  5 had an illegal value
    ** On entry to DGEBAL, parameter number  3 had an illegal value
    mx.metal.device_info is deprecated and will be removed ...

The display could not redraw over what it had not written, so each left a
stale half-drawn copy of itself in the scrollback.  Three writes, three
stale frames — the same three at every terminal height, which is what
showed the display was not simply too tall for the screen.
