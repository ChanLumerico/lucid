"""The suite stage splits the tree; these are the two ways that went wrong.

Both bugs shipped and both were found by running the gate, not by
reading it, which is what these tests are for.

1. **Chunks must partition.**  Naming a directory *and* something under
   it runs the descendant twice and doubles its counts, so the gate
   reports a suite larger than the one that exists.

2. **A chunk of entirely-skipped tests is not a dead chunk.**  pytest
   exits ``0`` and prints "16 skipped" with no passed, failed or errored
   among them.  Judging liveness on those three words called that a
   chunk that had died — and the whole stage unfinished — on a tree
   where the reference framework simply is not installed.
