"""Regression test for the compile-path output-buffer lifecycle bug.

Discovered 2026-05-26 while investigating the
``perf-compile-vs-eager-2026-05-26`` parity divergence at gpt2_block
@ BS=128.  The async ``encodeToCommandBuffer:`` + ``commit`` path in
``CompiledExecutable.mm::run_executable`` was silently overwriting
output MTLBuffers to zeros after roughly N consecutive ``cm(x)``
calls without intermediate materialisation (N ≈ 14 for transformer-
block-sized outputs, ~50 for CIFAR-block-sized outputs).  The
computation completed correctly but the output buffer lifecycle got
tangled in MLX's async tracker.

Fix (2026-05-26): default to the synchronous
``runWithMTLCommandQueue:waitUntilCompleted:YES`` path.  ``LUCID_COMPILE_ASYNC=1``
opts back into the async path for users who know their workload doesn't
hit the threshold.

This test exercises the GPT-2-block reproducer at N=20 (well above
the failure threshold of 14) and asserts the last call's output
still has the correct max value.  Under the buggy async-default code,
this test failed deterministically.  Under the sync default, it
passes.

If you tighten this test (lower N, smaller workload) be aware: the
bug threshold depends on output footprint, so a much smaller model
may not hit it.  GPT-2-block @ BS=32 is the sweet spot — small
enough to run fast, large enough that the buffer pool exhausts
quickly under async dispatch.
