"""Compiled training (``make_step``) against eager backward, case by case.

The cases are the float32 cases of :mod:`._op_matrix`, each wrapped as
``fn(x * w)`` so the gradient reaches the parameter ``w`` through the op —
see :mod:`._grad_matrix`.  A fallback to eager is allowed only where
:data:`EXPECTED_EAGER_GRAD` says why.

Before this test, a manual-VJP gap handed the whole backward to MPSGraph's
automatic differentiation, which aborted the process for 28 of these cases
(``where``, ``leaky_relu``, ``elu``, ``max``, ``cumsum``, ``bce``, …) and
returned a wrong gradient for 3 (``arcsin``, ``triu`` / ``tril`` off the
diagonal).  That fallback is now taken only for traces made of ops measured
to differentiate correctly.

A case with nothing to differentiate — no floating output, or one that does
not depend on ``w`` — is not generated: it is listed in :data:`NO_GRAD`, and
:func:`test_no_grad_case_still_has_none` holds it there.  An unlisted case
that finds nothing to differentiate fails.
