"""Three-dimensional resampling, with depth taken out of the resize.

MPSGraph's resamplers are two-dimensional, and the stub reason filed
against these two said the depth axis could not be folded away "because
resize would blend across the folded channels". A 2-D resize does not
touch the channel axis, so it does not — and resampling is separable, so
depth can ride along as channels while height and width are resized and
then be its own one-dimensional resample over the result.

Depth goes through a gather rather than a repeat, which is what lets the
same path serve a fractional ratio and a downsample. ``align_corners``
changes which source plane each output plane reads, so both settings are
covered: agreeing on the default would say nothing about the flag.
