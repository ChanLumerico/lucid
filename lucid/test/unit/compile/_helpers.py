"""Shared helpers for the ``lucid.compile`` unit test surface.

The compile-side tests assert two properties against the eager path:

  * **Bit-exact parity** — every cached executable produces the same
    tensors the eager path would.  ``assert_compile_parity`` runs both
    paths and compares with ``rtol=0`` / ``atol=0`` by default; loosen
    on a case-by-case basis (we expect 0.0 for inference paths).

  * **Cache state** — ``compile_cached`` builds a :class:`CompiledModule`
    and primes it with one warm-up call so subsequent invocations are
    guaranteed-cache-hit, which keeps the parity assertions free of
    first-call recompile noise.

These helpers are deliberately small: every test should still read top
to bottom.  They live in this folder (not ``lucid/test/_helpers``)
because they only make sense for the compile suite.
