"""Every op-matrix case compiled with ``dynamic=True``, called at four batches.

``test_dynamic_batch`` checks a handful of models.  This runs each case of
:mod:`._op_matrix` that has a batch axis through ``lucid.compile(...,
dynamic=True)`` at the traced batch and at three others, against eager at
each — whatever the compile decided: one symbolic executable, or a static one
per shape after the gate or an emitter declined.

Its first run found the symbolic path answering for every batch with the
traced one baked in: ``std(x, dim=0)`` scaled by the traced ``n/(n-1)``;
``permute(1, 0)``, ``diagonal`` and ``batch_norm_eval`` returning the traced
batch's shape; ``split`` along the batch returning the traced number of
pieces; ``roll`` over it, wrong values.  And it aborted the process —
uncatchably — in MPSGraph for ``.mT.contiguous()``, ``conv1d``, the
transposed convolutions, nearest resize, and a gather whose index is
shorter than its input (on the static path too).  The gate now refuses a
graph that moves, reduces, splits, rolls or gathers along the batch axis,
and those emitters decline a symbolic batch they cannot carry.
