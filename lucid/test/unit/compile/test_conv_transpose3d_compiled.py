"""Transposed 3-D convolution, through the convolution's data gradient.

MPSGraph exposes ``convolutionTranspose2D`` and no 3-D counterpart, so
this was a stub filed under "SDK 2-D only".  That reason was true about
the name and wrong about the capability: a transposed convolution *is*
the data gradient of a convolution, and ``convolution3DDataGradient``
has been exposed since macOS 13.2.

The layout falls out of the same reading.  The forward convolution being
differentiated consumes this op's output and produces its input, so its
weight is OIDHW with O the transposed op's input channels — which is
exactly how Lucid stores the weight, ``(Cin, Cout/g, kD, kH, kW)``.
Nothing is permuted.
