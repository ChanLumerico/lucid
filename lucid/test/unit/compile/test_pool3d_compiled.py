"""Three-dimensional pooling, through the SDK's four-dimensional one.

MPSGraph ships 2-D and 4-D pooling and nothing between, and Lucid's 3-D
pool is a rank-5 tensor, so this was a stub with the reason written down:
"the SDK only ships 2D variants (or 4D-spatial via rank-6 pooling, not
the rank-5 form Lucid uses)".

The rank is the whole of the gap. A length-1 spatial axis in front makes
the volume rank 6, the 4-D operation pools it with a kernel of 1 on that
axis, and the axis comes back out — so the reason was accurate about the
shapes and wrong about the conclusion.
