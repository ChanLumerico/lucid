"""Keyword-passed tensor inputs compile (they used to force eager).

The MPSGraph feed list is positional, but a forward called as
``model(x, mask=mask)`` is common (attention masks, optional conditioning,
``token_type_ids=`` …).  The compiler traces those keyword tensors like
positional ones and binds each executable feed back to either an ``args``
index or a ``kwargs`` name at call time (``_CacheEntry.input_source``).

Three properties pinned here:

  1. **A keyword tensor compiles** — one cache entry, no eager fallback,
     fp32-parity vs eager.
  2. **Re-keying on a non-tensor kwarg** — a different scalar kwarg value
     is captured by the signature, so it recompiles instead of silently
     reusing the wrong executable.
  3. **Dropping a kwarg between calls falls back gracefully** — the
     per-call feed resolver run-eagers rather than feeding ``None``.
