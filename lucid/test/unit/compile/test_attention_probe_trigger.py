"""Regression: the attention capability probe must fire for fused-SDPA graphs.

``maybe_probe_for_graph`` used to scan the trace for a ``softmax`` node only.
Manual attention (``softmax(QKᵀ) @ V``) has one; the **fused**
``scaled_dot_product_attention`` op does not — its whole computation is a
single node.  So a graph whose attention came from ``F.scaled_dot_product_
attention`` (i.e. every model-zoo family since the fused-SDPA migration, plus
``nn.MultiheadAttention``) never probed, the workaround flag stayed pinned at
its conservative ``-1``, and every such compile emitted the transposed
value-matmul forever — on hardware where the MPSGraph fusion bug does not even
exist.

Measured cost of that on an unaffected GPU (B=2, H=8, D=64, decomposed path):

    T= 128   0.687 ms -> 0.409 ms   (1.68x)
    T= 256   0.702 ms -> 0.508 ms   (1.38x)
    T= 512   1.213 ms -> 0.958 ms   (1.27x)
    T=1024   2.805 ms -> 2.606 ms   (1.08x)

The win shrinks as T grows because the transpose amortises against the O(T²)
matmul, so this mattered most for short-sequence inference.

Correctness was never at risk: ``-1`` means "apply the workaround", which is
the always-correct setting.  This is purely a performance gate that never
opened.
