"""Cache LRU eviction + memory-growth bound tests.

The process-global ``ExecutableCache::session()`` is LRU-bounded
(default 32, overridable via ``LUCID_COMPILE_MAX_CACHE``).  Two
properties must hold for compile mode to be safe in long-running
services and shape-variable workloads (NLP variable-length sequences,
dataloader batching that includes a remainder batch, …):

  1. The session cache size never exceeds the LRU cap.
  2. Repeatedly compiling new signatures evicts the oldest entries
     rather than growing unboundedly.

If either invariant breaks, a long-running service compiling a model
on a shape-variable input stream will OOM on the cumulative MPSGraph
executables.
