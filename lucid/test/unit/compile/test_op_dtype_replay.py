"""Every compile emitter, over float32 / int64 / int32 / bool, against eager.

The cases live in :mod:`._op_matrix`.  Each is compiled, traced on one
input and replayed on another, and must match eager on the second — read
back through ``.numpy()``, which is the path that once reported every
compiled integer output as float32.

A fallback to eager is allowed only where :data:`EXPECTED_EAGER` says why;
any other fallback fails, so a graph that stops compiling is seen the day
it happens.  An expected fallback that starts compiling passes — delete its
entry.

The matrix found, in its first rounds, answers that were silently wrong
(integer ``topk``, ``scatter`` on int64, ``erfinv(±1)``, float math on
integers, one executable shared by two callables returning different
tensors), graphs that aborted the process (``~`` on bool, ``all`` returned
directly), and ops eager itself got wrong (``arcsin`` on integers).
