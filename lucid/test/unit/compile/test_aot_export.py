"""AOT export: what ``save_compiled`` / ``load_compiled`` actually promise.

The pair had no test at all, and the one probe that touched it — the
audit's ``CompiledAxis`` — ran a closure over a single tensor.  One feed
has exactly one ordering, so the probe could not see the half of the
contract that was broken: a reloaded ``.mpsgraphpackage`` does not report
the feed order it expects, and that order only survives while every feed
shares a shape and dtype.  Anything else (any module, since weights and
activations rarely share a shape) used to be bound under the wrong slot's
shape, and MetalPerformanceShaders aborted the process — uncatchable, so
no assertion could have run afterwards.

What is pinned here:

* a uniform-feed artefact round-trips bit-exactly, and the feed *order*
  survives — checked with an expression no permutation leaves alone;
* an artefact whose feeds differ is refused in Python, never bound;
* a feed of the wrong shape or dtype raises before it reaches MPSGraph.

The last one is why these tests can exist: every assertion below is
reachable only because a mis-bound feed now raises instead of killing the
interpreter.
