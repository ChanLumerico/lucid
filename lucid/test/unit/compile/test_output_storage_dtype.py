"""A compiled output's storage has to carry its dtype, not only its tensor.

``run_executable`` wrapped every output MTLBuffer in a ``GpuStorage`` whose
``dtype`` and ``nbytes`` were left at their defaults, ``F32`` and ``0``.
The tensor around it said ``int64``; the storage said ``float32``; every
reader that asks the storage took its word.  ``.numpy()`` is one — an
int64 ``x * 2 + 1`` came back as a float32 array of integer bit patterns
(15 read as ``2.1e-44``).  ``.to("cpu")`` and any eager op on the result
went through MLX, which knows the real dtype, so every test that compared
after one of those passed.
