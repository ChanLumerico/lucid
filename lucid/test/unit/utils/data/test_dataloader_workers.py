"""DataLoader worker processes: their random streams and their lifecycle.

Two families of defect lived here, and neither announced itself.

* Workers never seeded Lucid's generator, so every worker drew the same
  "random" augmentation and every epoch repeated the last one — a run
  trained on a fraction of the variation it was configured for, and
  converged anyway.
* The pool's bookkeeping: ``get_worker_info().num_workers`` was always 0,
  a ``break`` out of a persistent epoch let its leftovers leak into the
  next one (duplicates and gaps, right batch count), and a worker that
  raised or died left the loader waiting forever.

Every test here is bounded — an alarm turns a hang into a failure — and
checks that it left no worker process behind.  Datasets the workers
unpickle live in :mod:`._worker_datasets`.
