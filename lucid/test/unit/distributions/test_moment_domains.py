"""Regression tests: moments outside the range their formula is valid on.

Found 2026-08-04 by the audit's ``distribution`` axis, after it stopped
treating a non-finite moment as a defect.  That check was answering the
wrong question — whether a moment is finite is a property of the
*parameters*, and the axis did not choose them: Cauchy has no mean at any
parameter, Pareto none for α ≤ 1, StudentT no variance for ν ≤ 2.  The
reference returns NaN and infinity for exactly those, because a divergent
integral is an answer.

What it checks instead holds of every distribution at every parameter: a
variance is not negative, and a standard deviation is its square root.
Both survive infinity — and both caught real defects immediately, because
three distributions evaluated their closed form outside the range it is
valid on and returned a *negative* variance rather than the divergence it
stands for.
