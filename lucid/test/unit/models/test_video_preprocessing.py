"""What the video preset does, and which convention it takes.

The V-JEPA families ship a preprocessing preset rather than the no-op
they carried at first: without one a caller holding a decoded clip has
no way to reach the numbers the published weights expect.

Compared against the released ``VJEPA2VideoProcessor``, a float clip
through this preset agrees to ``1.1e-4`` — the pipeline is the same
computation. Two things had to be right for that:

* the resize target truncates. ``int(256 * 256 / 224)`` is 292 and
  ``round`` gives 293, one pixel that moves the crop window and
  rescales everything inside it;
* the centre crop places an **odd** margin *down*, not to nearest.
  A 292x519 frame cropped to 256 starts at column 131 under Hugging
  Face's fast processors and 132 under the rounding that torchvision
  and Albumentations use. These weights are published through the
  former. A square frame cannot see the difference — its margin is
  even — which is why the first version of this file missed it.

Handing the preset ``uint8`` and the reference the same leaves a
uniform ``1.74e-2``, which is ``1/255`` divided by the blue channel's
std: the reference rounds back to ``uint8`` between stages and Lucid
stays in float. That is Lucid computing the same thing more precisely,
so it is recorded rather than matched.
