"""The distributional regression head, and what it is actually for.

The motivation is easy to state and easy to test badly. "A squared error
scales with the target" suggests a head fitted to large rewards should
fail outright, and with a plain optimiser it would — but Adam normalises
per parameter, and a squared-error head fitted to a *single* large
constant does fine. Measured: 0.6% relative error at a target of 100000,
against the two-hot's 0.00%. Better, not decisive.

Where it becomes decisive is one head covering several magnitudes at
once, which is the real case: a reward head sees the whole range inside a
single batch. There the squared error is dominated by the large entries
and the small ones are simply not fitted. That is the comparison below,
and the numbers in it are measured rather than assumed.
