"""Every generative family's ``Examples`` block has to actually run.

Doctests are in no other gate — not in ``pyproject.toml``'s ``addopts``,
not in any workflow — so an example that raises, or that states a value
the code does not produce, ships silently.  That is a real defect rather
than a cosmetic one: these blocks are what the documentation site renders
and what a reader copies out.

Found the hard way.  ``check_docstring_coverage`` was green throughout
while ``NeuralODEConfig``'s example raised ``ValueError`` on the first
line and claimed a ``data_dim`` the code never returns — that checker
validates presence and shape, not whether an example is true.

Scoped to ``lucid.models.generative`` on purpose.  The rest of the
package is not clean yet: ``lucid/optim``'s examples are deliberate
sketches over an undefined ``model``, and ``lucid/linalg``'s were written
against an older tensor repr.  Both are worth a sweep; neither is a
reason to gate nothing.
