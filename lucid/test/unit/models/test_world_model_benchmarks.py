"""Control benchmarks — the claims the suite deliberately cannot make.

``test_world_model_control.py`` runs in seconds and says so about its
limits: on a fixed target the best constant action scores 15.78 against
random's 5.77, so every "beats random" threshold there is clearable by a
policy that never looks at its observation.

This file removes that escape rather than documenting it. The goal moves
each episode, so a constant is good for one episode and wrong for the
next, and the ceiling for an observation-blind policy becomes a
*measurable number* — the best constant's own return. Beating it is not
a threshold someone picked; it is the only thing a blind policy cannot
do.

Opt in with ``-m control``. Minutes, not seconds, which is why it is
excluded from the default run.

Measured on an M4 Max, moving target, horizon 20:

===============================  ======  =========================
policy                           return  vs the best constant
===============================  ======  =========================
random                            12.90  0.91x
best constant (grid over 25)      14.15  1.00x  (the blind ceiling)
DreamerV3, 1000 gradient steps    16.78  1.19x
greedy (reads the goal)           19.21  1.36x
===============================  ======  =========================

So v3 recovers roughly 60% of the distance from random to a controller
that is handed the goal coordinates. The curve is not monotone —
individual evaluations dip to 0.86x between peaks — so the assertion is
on the best evaluation over the run, and the run is short enough that
"best of six" is not a fishing expedition.

What this still does not establish is the paper's own scores. This is a
64x64 toy with a dense Gaussian reward, not the Control Suite, and no
claim about DMC or Atari numbers should be read out of it.
