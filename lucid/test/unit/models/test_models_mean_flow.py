"""MeanFlow — the identities the method rests on, not just the shapes.

A shape test would pass on a model that had the Jacobian-vector product's
tangent wrong, which is the one mistake this method cannot survive: the
paper's destructive ablation puts the correct tangent at FID 61.06 and
every incorrect one between 137 and 329.  So the tests here assert the
equations instead — that the target reduces to Flow Matching's when
``r = t``, that the total derivative decomposes the way the chain rule
says, and that the sampler implements Eq. 12 rather than something that
merely returns the right shape.

Each is paired with the mis-wiring it would catch.
