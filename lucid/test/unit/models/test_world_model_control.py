"""Does a world model learn to act at all?

Everything else in the suite checks the parts. Shapes are right, gradients
reach the modules they should, losses fall, lambda-returns match the
paper's closed form. None of it would catch a recurrence that carries the
wrong state forward, because a model like that still reconstructs frames
and still reports a shrinking loss.

So this closes the loop: seed a replay buffer, train the three objectives,
collect with the policy being learned, and check the return beats random.

**What this does not establish.** The target here is fixed, so a policy
that ignores its observation entirely and pushes in one direction already
scores 15.78 against random's 5.77 — measured, and pinned below. Passing
these therefore shows the agent found a good *constant* action, not that
it learned to read a state and respond to it.

State-dependent control **is** achieved, but not here and not this
cheaply. On a variant with the target moved each episode, where no
constant action works, DreamerV2 with proper interleaved collection
reaches 2.34x the best constant policy and 71% of the greedy optimum —
8000 gradient steps, seventeen minutes on Metal. That is a benchmark, not
a unit test, so what lives in the suite is this cheaper check with its
limitation written down rather than assumed away.

The tests are kept because "finds the best constant action" is still far
more than the rest of the suite establishes — a mis-wired recurrence
fails it — but the name of the file should not be read as more than that.

Cost, measured on an M1 Pro: about 45 seconds for both families.

    """v3 driven through the rollout layer, which nothing else does.

    **What this establishes.** That the loop closes and that the world
    model learns the task's reward from episodes it collected itself.
    The last part is the load-bearing one: the reward head is a
    distribution over symlog bins rather than a scalar, so "the number
    came out right" passes through two-hot encoding, a categorical
    cross-entropy and ``symexp`` — none of which a shape test exercises
    and all of which can be wired backwards while still training.

    **What it does not establish.** That the policy learns. Not because
    it does not — at ``lr`` 8e-4 on the actor and 3e-3 on the world
    model it reaches 2.16-2.84x random on five seeds out of five, and the
    imagined lambda-return it is actually maximising climbs from about
    zero to 3.4-5.6 on every one — but because on this task that number
    means less than it looks. The best constant action scores 15.78
    against random's 5.77, and 15.78 is precisely where all five runs
    land. So the honest reading is "found a good constant", the same
    reading the file's header gives v1 and v2.

    Two rates below and one above that window do *not* learn, which is
    worth knowing before reading a failure here as a defect: at 2e-2 the
    actor's gradient collapses to 1e-3 by step 80 with its entropy back
    at the uniform limit, and 200 gradient steps is short of the ~300
    this needs. Both were mistaken for a broken actor-critic until the
    objective was tested on its own, where a known advantage moves the
    continuous mode from -0.08 to +1.0000 inside 100 steps.

    State-dependent control needs a task no constant can win, so it is
    measured in ``test_world_model_benchmarks.py`` on the moving-target
    variant rather than asserted here.

    This is the seam that hid a real defect: episodes collected from an
    accelerator environment split across devices, because rewards arrive
    as Python floats and landed on the CPU while the frames did not. The
    rollout layer is tested without a model and the models are tested
    on-device without the rollout layer, so nothing saw it.
