"""Every training step costs exactly what ``step_cost.json`` says.

The gate the nightly wall-clock job could not be: a timing on a shared
runner measures the runner, so it was recorded and never enforced.  These
counts — storages allocated, freed and at their peak, forward ops by name,
host storages made during a GPU step, a compiled step's executables and
eager fallbacks — depend only on the code, so they are exact on any
machine, and any change is one somebody made.

Strict both ways.  A step that got costlier fails with what grew.  One that
got cheaper fails too, until the budget is rewritten with
``python -m lucid.test.unit.cost --update`` — otherwise the gain could be
lost again without a test noticing.
