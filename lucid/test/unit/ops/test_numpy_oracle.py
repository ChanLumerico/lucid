"""Eager against numpy, on CPU and on Metal, for every case with a reference.

The replay matrices compare compiled with eager, so they cannot see an op
eager gets wrong on both devices alike.  This one holds eager to an answer
computed independently — see :mod:`._numpy_oracle` for the table and for
the cases it deliberately leaves out.

Two rules keep numpy's own conventions from being mistaken for Lucid's
defects: values are compared after casting (numpy's ``floor`` of an integer
is float64, the reference framework's is integer), and the dtype *kind* is
enforced only for :data:`REAL_VALUED` ops — an integer input to ``arcsin``
must come back floating point, whatever width.

Nothing here is skipped.  A dtype eager refuses is not generated: it is
listed in ``_op_matrix.EAGER_REJECTS`` and held there by
``test_op_eager_rejects``, and an unlisted refusal fails.  An input numpy has
no answer for either gets an adapter with the reference framework's answer
in :data:`REFS`, or — where that framework refuses and Lucid answers — an
entry in :data:`DIVERGES`, which pins Lucid's answer instead.

H4: numpy computes expected values here and nowhere else; Lucid values reach
it only through ``Tensor.numpy()``.
