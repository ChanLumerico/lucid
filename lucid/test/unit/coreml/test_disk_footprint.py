"""A test in this directory leaves nothing on the disk behind it.

Core ML specialises every package it loads into a bundle holding a full
copy of the weights, and never reads that bundle again once the handle
is closed.  Left to accumulate, a run of this directory took a disk with
38 GB free past macOS's near-low-disk mark, and the purge that followed
landed under a prediction Core ML was preparing — the process aborted
inside Core ML's GPU encoder (CHA-22; the conftest has the account).

So the conftest gives Core ML a home inside the session's temporary
directory, and Lucid's compile cache a directory beside it, and removes,
after each passing test, the packages it wrote, the compiled models kept
for them and the bundles they produced.  These tests hold it to that: the
first writes and loads a package, the second looks for what the first
left.
