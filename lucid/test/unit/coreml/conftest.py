"""What the Core ML tests may not do to the machine running them.

Inside a virtual machine
------------------------
A hosted CI runner is a macOS virtual machine, and the Core ML runtime
inside it is not the one on a device.  There is no Neural Engine, and the
GPU goes unused: the probe in ``.github/workflows/coreml-vm-probe.yml``
got the same answer, to the last digit, from CPU_ONLY, CPU_AND_GPU and
ALL — every package on BNNS's CPU path.  That path lands one comparison
a thousand times further from eager than on hardware and traps at
prediction on two unrelated packages: SIGTRAP, nothing in the log, and
the rest of the suite gone with the process.  Other compute units do not
route around it.

So under a hypervisor, loading a package — the step
every prediction, verification and compute plan goes through — skips the
test instead.  Tracing and writing the package still run there; executing
it is left to hardware.

Session-scoped, so a module- or class-scoped fixture that loads a
package is refused too rather than slipping in before a per-test patch.

On the disk
-----------
Every package Core ML loads is compiled and then specialised into a
bundle under ``~/Library/Caches/<app>/com.apple.e5rt.e5bundlecache`` that
holds a full copy of the weights — 1.1 GB for YOLO v1.  The bundle is
keyed by the compiled model's path, and the runtime used to compile to a
fresh path on every load, so no bundle was ever read twice; they stay
until macOS purges them.  By 41% of one run of this directory there were
7 GB of them, beside 14 GB of packages kept in ``tmp_path`` for the rest
of the session, and the disk that had 38 GB free was down to 118 MB.
(``lucid.coreml`` now keeps one compiled model per package content, so a
package opened again reuses its bundle — but every *distinct* package a
test writes still costs a compiled model and a bundle, and this
directory writes hundreds.)

Long before full, the disk crosses macOS's near-low-disk mark, and
``cache_delete`` purges those bundles — 3.4 GB in under a second.  Twice
that landed while Core ML was preparing the first YOLO prediction, and
Core ML aborted the process from inside its own GPU encoder
(``MPSGraphTensorData.mm:266``, ``shape.count != strides.count``) 95 ms
and 54 ms after the purge finished.  Nothing of Lucid's is on that path;
what Lucid controls is how much disk the suite eats.

So the session gives Core ML a home of its own inside the session's
temporary directory — ``CFFIXED_USER_HOME``, which Core ML reads once, at
the first load in the process — and Lucid's compile cache a directory of
its own beside it (``LUCID_COREML_CACHE_DIR``), and every test removes the
packages it wrote, the compiled models kept for them and the bundles they
produced.  A failing test keeps all three, to be looked at.
