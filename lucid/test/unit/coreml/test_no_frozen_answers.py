"""An exported package must answer its input, not the one it was traced with.

Every other numeric test in this directory compares one prediction
against one eager run. That cannot see the worst failure this subsystem
has: a package whose answer was decided while tracing. Such a package
loads, reports no error, agrees perfectly with the model on the input it
was built from, and returns that same answer for every input afterwards.

The compile backend has the same hazard and the same test —
``test_no_frozen_results.py`` — written after ``fft.fftn`` was off by 20
on its second call. The export path reaches it two ways. A traced value
that the builder decides is a constant is frozen by definition, so the
question is only whether it really was one; and the graph is walked from
the outputs, so an operation whose input edges the tracer failed to
record looks like it depends on nothing.

The property is checked rather than the mechanism: export, call with two
inputs the eager model distinguishes, and require the answer to move.
