"""What float16 costs a particular model, asked as a question.

The Neural Engine runs float16 and nothing else, so every export that
wants the accelerator accepts whatever half precision does to that
network — and it varies by more than an order of magnitude between
architectures that look alike. Measured on an untrained forward across
fourteen families: convolutional stacks near 1e-3, ViT at 1e-2, MaxViT
at 1.6e-1. Nothing in an export said which kind a given model was, and
the subsystem pushes people toward float16 for the accelerator, so the
gap mattered.

``precision_cost`` exports twice and compares both against eager. These
tests are about the measurement being trustworthy rather than about any
particular number: that it separates precisions at all, that it inherits
the refusal when the model answers with zeros, and that it does not
leave packages behind.

The float16 figure is Core ML's, and Core ML is better at half precision
than running the same network in half throughout — a ViT does that at
1.5 relative against 1e-2 here, because the runtime keeps the parts that
need range in float32. That is why this measures the export rather than
simulating half precision in Lucid.
