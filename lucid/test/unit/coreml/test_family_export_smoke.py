"""One model per architecture family, exported and compared.

The rest of this directory tests operations one at a time and models
three at a time. That is what let a `gather` emitted for the wrong
opset, a rank cap that refused every windowed transformer, and an
operation listed as "never traced" that LP pooling traces, all sit in
the tree at once: each was reachable only from an architecture nothing
exported.

So this walks families rather than operations. It is deliberately not
the whole zoo — 440 factories at inference size is not a unit test — but
one representative per family, at a small input, is enough to keep the
class of defect from returning silently. Everything here passed when it
was written; a new entry that fails is a real gap, not a flaky test.

Families whose input is not a single image tensor (detection heads with
multiple inputs, generative samplers, world models) are named in
``NOT_SINGLE_IMAGE`` rather than left out, so the list says what it does
not cover.
