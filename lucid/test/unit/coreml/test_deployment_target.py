"""Which systems a package will run on, said out loud.

Three features move a program from the ``CoreML7`` opset to ``CoreML8``,
and until this existed they moved it silently: carrying state,
palettizing weights, and writing several entry points into one package.
A caller who needed iOS 17 got a package that loads on iOS 18 and
nowhere earlier, with nothing in the export saying so — the kind of
thing you find out from a device, after shipping.

Two directions, both here. Ask for a floor the package cannot meet and
the export stops, naming the feature that raised it and the argument
that asked for it. Ask for nothing and the package tells you what floor
it ended up with.

There is no target below ``IOS17`` because the emitters do not write
below it: ``gather`` and ``scatter`` carry ``validate_indices``, which
iOS 16 has no field for. That is a change to the emitters, not a missing
enum member, and the test at the end says so rather than leaving the
absence to be read as an oversight.
