"""Models that draw random numbers, and how a package can hold one.

Core ML has no random operation. A draw takes no inputs, so it is a
constant as far as the compiler is concerned, and it folds at build
time — the package returns one sample for the life of the file. That is
refused by default, and the refusal is the most important one this
subsystem makes: nothing about such a package looks wrong. It loads, the
numbers are plausible, and a variational encoder's latent never moves.

It also stopped seven families in the zoo from being exported at all,
which is the largest single blocker measured: variational encoders,
world models with a stochastic latent, score-based samplers.

``Draws.AS_INPUT`` lifts each draw to an input the caller fills. Nothing
is lost by it, because the draw was never part of the network:
``mu + sigma * eps`` is a function of ``eps``, and that the eager model
makes its own on the way past is an artifact of running in Python. The
handle draws for a caller who passes nothing, so the package still
answers differently on each prediction the way the model does; a caller
who passes one gets a deterministic function, which is the other reason
to want this.

Comparing one against its eager model needs care. Running the model
again draws different numbers, so its values cannot be the reference —
the two sides would be computing different things and the difference
would be the draw. ``verify`` feeds the package the sample the trace
drew and compares against what the trace answered, which is the only
pairing where both sides saw the same numbers. A reopened handle does
not have them and says so.
