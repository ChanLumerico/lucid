"""Palettization and sparsity: what the package stores, and what runs it.

Both settings replace a weight with something smaller and lossy, which
makes them the easiest place in the subsystem to be wrong without
anything saying so — a mis-packed key stream or a table read at the wrong
stride still loads, still predicts, and still returns numbers of about
the right size.

So the tests here do not compare the compressed model against the
original. They compare it against **its own reconstruction**: the exact
values the tables and keys say the weight should now hold. That
separates the two questions. Whether four bits is enough for a given
model is the caller's trade to make and ``verify`` measures it; whether
the package computes what it claims to store is this file's business,
and the answer has to be exact.

That distinction is what caught the one real defect here. Core ML's GPU
path expands ``constexpr_lut_to_dense`` incorrectly for palette sizes 4,
16 and 256 — silently, with no error and plausible-looking output. A
comparison against the original model reads that as "four-bit
palettization is lossy", which it also is; only a comparison against the
package's own tables separates a wrong answer from an approximate one.
``lucid.coreml`` now keeps palettized models off that path, and the last
test here is what notices if that stops working.
