"""What a prediction does to the rest of the process.

A package is a deployment artifact, and deployments are threaded: a
request handler, a metrics thread, an event loop, a health check. None
of those are predicting, and all of them used to stop dead while
something else was.

The engine never released the interpreter lock. It costs nothing where
an operation takes microseconds, which is every other call in Lucid, and
it is a different thing entirely for Core ML: one prediction of a
moderate convolutional stack runs for tens of milliseconds, and the lock
was held across all of it. Measured before the fix, a 53 ms prediction
froze an unrelated Python thread for 78 ms — the prediction plus the
work either side of it. A server predicting continuously would not have
run anything else at all.

Nothing in ``predict`` or ``classify`` touches Python — they take
tensor implementations and return them — so the lock is dropped for the
call itself and taken again before the result is converted. Compiling a
package, which is the longest call here at seconds for a large one, does
the same.

Two things that had been resting on the lock without saying so:

The handle could be closed from another thread while a prediction was in
flight. Serialised by the lock, that was impossible; without it, the
model would be freed underneath the call. It is held by shared ownership
now, so closing during a prediction frees the model after that
prediction rather than during it.

A stateful package keeps one ``MLState`` that every prediction reads and
writes. Core ML's prediction is safe to call concurrently; sharing that
object across concurrent calls is not, and the result would be lost
updates rather than a crash — the quiet kind. Those predictions queue.

Throughput is a separate question and the lock was never the answer to
it: four threads reach 1.3x one thread both before and after, because
the Neural Engine is one piece of hardware and the work queues there.
What changed is that the rest of the process keeps running.
