"""A package reopened must be the package that was written.

The handle ``export`` returns knows things the export decided: that an
input is a picture and not an array, that the outputs are labels and not
scores, which system the package needs. ``load`` used to know none of
it, so the same file behaved differently depending on how it was
opened — and in a deployment, reopening is the ordinary path. You export
once and load forever after.

Both failures were real. A reloaded image package refused every
prediction, because Core ML will not take a multi-array where the model
declares a picture. A reloaded classifier refused ``classify``, saying
the package returns scores — which it does not.

The package declares all of it, so it is read back from the model rather
than asked for again. One thing cannot be: the pixel normalisation is
written into the *program*, as an ordinary multiply and add at the head,
not into anything the file declares. A reloaded handle can predict
without it and cannot compare without it, and the last test here is that
the difference is stated rather than guessed at.
