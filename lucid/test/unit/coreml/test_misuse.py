"""How a package answers a caller who drives it wrongly.

Every other file here asks whether a correct call produces a correct
answer. This one asks what happens to an incorrect one, which is the
half a person actually meets: the shapes are close but not equal, a
tensor is passed where the model wanted two, the handle was closed in a
``finally`` further up.

Core ML itself is good about most of it — a wrong shape, a wrong rank and
a wrong channel count all come back naming both sides. The gaps were on
the Lucid side of the boundary, and one of them did not raise at all.

Passing a sequence one element too long dropped the extra silently.
``zip`` stops at the shorter side, and the count that was supposed to
catch a mismatch was taken *after* the pairing — so it compared the
truncated list against the input names and found them equal. A caller
who added an argument to their model and re-exported it, but fed the old
package, got a prediction that ignored their new input and no
indication of it.

The rest is about error text. A list of floats used to surface
``'float' object has no attribute 'dtype'``, which names an internal
attribute and not the mistake; and a float64 input was told that Core ML
has no int64, which is true and has nothing to do with what it was
given.
