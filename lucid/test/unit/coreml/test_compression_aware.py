"""Training a model against the compression it will be shipped with.

Fitting a palette to a finished model is the cheap thing, and measured
on a trained ResNet-50 it is not enough: four-bit palettization changes
every one of five top-1 predictions. Two export-time remedies were tried
and both failed — leaving the stem and classifier uncompressed did
nothing, and a table per channel was worse at six bits. The loss is
spread through the network, which is the shape of a problem no export
setting fixes.

What is left is to show the network the compression while it can still
learn. The forward pass uses the compressed weight; the optimizer
updates the full-precision one behind it, reached through
``w + (compress(w) - w).detach()`` because compression's own derivative
is zero almost everywhere.

Measured here on a small classifier trained to 0.98, against a control
that gets the same number of extra steps without compression — which
matters, since the first version of this measurement credited the
fine-tuning itself to the feature:

    bits   post-training   compression-aware
    2          0.982             0.995
    3          0.997             0.993
    4          0.997             0.995

It helps where the compression costs something and not otherwise, which
is what should be expected and is worth writing down: on a small model
at four bits there is nothing to recover.

The other half is that the export has to write the palette the model was
trained against. It did not. A settled weight holds exactly ``2**bits``
values per row and Lloyd's algorithm still came back 9.3e-03 away from
them — two initial centres can land inside one repeated value, leaving
another unclaimed, and an entry nothing lands on never moves again. The
fitter takes the values directly when there are few enough of them, and
the round trip is exact now.
