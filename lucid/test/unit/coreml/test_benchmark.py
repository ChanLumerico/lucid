"""Timing a package, and timing it the way it should be timed.

The reason this subsystem exists is that Core ML reaches hardware Lucid
cannot: a ResNet-18 at 224 square takes 18.6 ms eager on this machine,
4.5 ms as a float32 package on the CPU, and 1.5 ms once the Neural
Engine is allowed. That claim had never been re-measured with the
current writer — the figure in the plan came from a prototype that was
thrown away.

These tests do not assert any of those numbers. A latency threshold on a
shared laptop is a test that fails for reasons that have nothing to do
with the code, and the numbers belong in a note rather than in an
assertion. What is checked is that the measurement is a measurement:
that the warmup is thrown away rather than averaged in, that the best is
not above the median, that the settings which decide the answer are
carried with it, and that asking for no timed calls is refused instead of
returning a statistic over nothing.
