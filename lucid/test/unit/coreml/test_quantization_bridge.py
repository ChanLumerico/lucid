"""Models `lucid.quantization` produces, reaching the exporter.

Lucid has a quantization subsystem and an exporter, and until now nothing
carried a model from one to the other. Crossing the two found the reason:
a quantization-aware model carries observers that record the range of
every activation they see, and ``eval()`` does not stop them — correctly,
since post-training calibration runs in eval mode and *is* that
recording. Tracing is not calibration. It runs the model once to learn
its shape, and the observers wrote to their buffers while it did, so the
export refused the model as one that mutates itself.

They are paused around the trace now. Nothing about the exported program
changes: an observer contributes no operation, only a record.

What comes out is exact. A QAT model's weights have been trained onto
the int8 grid, so storing them as int8 costs nothing — measured on a
small classifier at 0.00e+00 against the eager model, where the same
network quantized after training lands at 7e-04 and loses accuracy the
QAT one keeps (0.997 against 0.986).

One thing this does not yet do, recorded because it is the next
question rather than a defect: the package carries the *activation*
fake-quantization as real arithmetic — 75 operations where the float
model has 10. That is faithful, and it is not what anyone wants on the
Neural Engine, which runs float16 activations whatever the package says.
Core ML's own quantization is weight-only, so simulating int8
activations in float is work the accelerator did not ask for. Dropping
them would change what the package computes, which is a choice to offer
rather than to make here.
