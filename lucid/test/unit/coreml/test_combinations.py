"""Every option, crossed with every other option.

Each feature of this subsystem has tests. Their combinations did not,
and that is where the last three defects of this kind came from: a
float16 body with an integer output, constant folding beside the rank-6
rewrite, constant folding beside carried state. Each was a pair that
worked separately.

Writing this file found a fourth. Palettizing a float16 export failed
outright — the weight is rounded to half before the palette is fitted,
and the edge table's sentinel is single precision, so Lloyd's algorithm
tried to concatenate the two. Nothing in the single-feature tests could
see it, because neither feature is wrong on its own.

The matrix is small on purpose. Thirty-two exports of a six-layer model
run in about a minute; a matrix that took ten would be one nobody runs.
What matters is that the axes are the ones that interact — how the body
computes, how the weights are stored, and what shape of interface the
package presents.
