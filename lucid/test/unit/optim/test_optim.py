    ``Optimizer::step`` writes each param back as an UNEVALUATED MLX array;
    without a per-step eval the lazy graph can pin every prior step's
    compute → unbounded active-memory / RSS growth on the GPU path.

    **This runs in its own process, and that is the whole point.** Two
    earlier versions of this test were wrong in ways worth recording,
    because both looked right and both produced a red CI for days.

    The first took ``get_active_memory()`` once before a 300-step loop and
    once after. That quantity *oscillates*: sampled over four consecutive
    windows on a loaded process it reads ``+16384, -16384, +16384, -16384``.
    A leak cannot go negative, so a single difference cannot tell monotone
    growth from an allocator holding a block at the moment you look.

    The second measured the trough across twelve windows, which is the
    right statistic — and it still failed, reporting a genuinely linear
    20480 B/step, exactly one step's forward activations, unbounded to
    61 MB over 3000 steps. That is what a real leak looks like. It was
    not one: it is absent in a fresh interpreter, absent from a standalone
    script under heavy allocation load, unaffected by an explicit
    ``_metal_eval_params()`` flush or a per-step ``.item()``, and not
    attributable to any single test directory. It appears only inside a
    large pytest session, which holds references this measurement cannot
    tell apart from the optimizer's own.

    Since the statistic is process-global, the measurement has to own the
    process. The subprocess measures Lucid; running it in-session measured
    pytest.
