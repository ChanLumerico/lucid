"""Regression test: the SVD backward was wrong for U and Vh.

Found 2026-08-05 by the audit's ``grad`` axis, which had been reporting
``lucid.linalg.svd`` at rel 1.36 for as long as the axis has existed.  It
was easy to dismiss: a left singular vector is defined only up to a sign,
so comparing ``U`` against another framework's shows columns differing by
a sign, and it is tempting to stop there.

What settles it is Lucid's *own* forward.  A central difference of it
agreed with the reference's analytic gradient to 6e-17 and disagreed with
Lucid's by 6e-1, on a matrix whose singular values are well separated —
so neither the sign convention nor a degeneracy was the explanation.

Three things were wrong in the Loewner term and they compounded rather
than cancelling: ``s_i`` where the derivation puts ``s_j``, the sign that
follows from writing ``s_i² - s_j²`` for its negative, and the
symmetrisation ``J + Jᵀ`` missing entirely so that only half the term
survived.

The check here is against Lucid's own forward rather than against the
reference, because that is the comparison the sign convention cannot
confuse.
