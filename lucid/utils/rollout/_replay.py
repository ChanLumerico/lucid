"""Episode storage with contiguous-chunk sampling.

The distinguishing requirement is in the sampling, not the storage.  A
recurrent state-space model learns from *sequences*: it is trained to
predict what follows from what came before, so a batch of loose
transitions gives it nothing to be recurrent about.  What it needs is
contiguous windows that do not straddle an episode boundary, which is
what this draws.

class SequenceReplay:
    r"""Whole episodes in, contiguous chunks out.

    Parameters
    ----------
    capacity : int, default=1_000_000
        Budget in *transitions*, not episodes.  Frames dominate the
        memory of a pixel-based agent — at 64x64x3 in float32 a single
        observation is 48 KiB, so a million of them is not a number to
        set carelessly — and counting episodes would let the true cost
        drift with their length.  Oldest episodes are dropped first.

    Attributes
    ----------
    episodes : list of Episode
        Stored trajectories, oldest first.

    Notes
    -----
    Episodes shorter than the requested chunk length are skipped rather
    than padded.  Padding would put frames into the sequence that the
    dynamics never produced, and the model has no way to tell them from
    real ones.

    Sampling picks an episode uniformly and then a start position within
    it uniformly, which is what the world-model papers' released code
    does.  Note the consequence: a step in a short episode is more likely
    to be drawn than a step in a long one.  Sampling uniformly over all
    valid start positions instead would remove that bias, and is a
    deliberate non-choice here — matching the reference matters more than
    correcting it.

    Schaul et al. describe exactly this: "a 'sum-tree' data structure,
    where every node is the sum of its children, with the priorities as
    the leaf nodes, which can be efficiently updated and sampled from."

    It is here rather than expressed with tensors because the obvious
    tensor formulation is a cumulative sum plus a search, and that is
    :math:`O(n)` in the buffer rather than :math:`O(\log n)` in it.
    Measured on this machine at a million leaves: the cumulative-sum form
    takes **196 ms** to draw a batch of 32, the tree **0.20 ms** — a
    factor of 973, against a training step of about 120 ms. The bottleneck
    is the algorithm, not the language, which is also why this is Python
    and not a new engine op: having fixed the complexity, a C++ tree would
    save a further 0.2% of a step.

    Reference: Schaul, Quan, Antonoglou, and Silver, *"Prioritized
    Experience Replay"*, ICLR, 2016 (arXiv:1511.05952).

    .. math::

        P(i) = \frac{p_i^\alpha}{\sum_k p_k^\alpha},
        \qquad
        w_i = \frac{(N \cdot P(i))^{-\beta}}{\max_j w_j},

    with proportional priorities :math:`p_i = |\delta_i| + \epsilon`.

    Prioritizes **episodes**, not individual transitions, because that is
    the unit this buffer stores and the unit a sequence model trains on.
    A chunk's priority is its episode's.

    Two details from the paper are easy to leave out and both matter.  A
    newly stored episode is given the **largest priority seen so far**,
    so that everything is replayed at least once before prioritization
    can bury it — Algorithm 1, line 6.  And the weights are normalised by
    their maximum "so that they only scale the update downwards", which
    keeps the correction from inflating any gradient.
