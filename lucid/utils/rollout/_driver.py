"""Policies and the loop that runs them against an environment.

This is the smallest of the three pieces and the one that earns its place
least obviously — it is a ``while not done`` loop.  What justifies it is
that two of the papers' hyperparameters live nowhere else: **action
repeat**, which decides how many environment steps one decision covers,
and the **exploration noise** added while collecting.  Both change the
data the world model is fitted to, and both are stated in the papers, so
leaving them to every caller to reinvent is how implementations quietly
diverge.

Deliberately not here: checkpointing, logging, evaluation schedules,
vectorised environments, anything resembling a ``Trainer``.  The training
loop stays the caller's.

    The ``reset`` is what distinguishes this from a plain function.  A

    has to be able to say "that was a different episode, start again".  A

class LatentPolicy:
    r"""Carries an RSSM belief through an episode and asks the model to act.

    A world model does not act from the frame in front of it; it acts from
    a belief it has been updating since the episode began.  So this holds
    that belief, folds each new observation into it, and hands it to
    whatever the model uses to choose — which is not the same method
    across the family, and is therefore passed in rather than assumed:
    Dreamer has a learned actor, PlaNet searches with a planner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    encode : callable
        ``(B, T, C, H, W) -> (B, T, embed)``, normally ``model.encode``.
    rssm : RSSM
        The model's recurrent state-space model.
    act : callable
        ``RSSMState -> (1, action_dim)``, given the single-step posterior.
        For Dreamer this is ``lambda s: model.act(s, sample=False)``.  For
        PlaNet it is the *task wrapper's* planner — ``plan`` lives on
        :class:`~lucid.models.PlaNetForWorldModeling`, not on the trunk,
        so the encoder and RSSM come from ``wrapper.planet`` while the
        planner comes from ``wrapper``.
    action_dim : int
        Width of the action vector.
    noise : float, default=0.0
        Standard deviation of Gaussian exploration noise added to the
        chosen action.  The papers collect with ``0.3`` and evaluate with
        ``0``.

    Notes
    -----
    The action is clipped into ``(-1, 1)`` whether or not noise was added,
    because that is what :class:`Policy` promises an environment.  Dreamer
    emits a ``tanh``-squashed action and the clip does nothing; PlaNet's
    planner searches an unbounded Gaussian and relies on it, which is the
    clipping the paper describes.

    Notes
    -----
    Runs under :func:`lucid.no_grad` — acting is not a thing to
    differentiate, and holding a graph across a whole episode would keep
    every frame alive.

    --------
    >>> import lucid

    Parameters
    ----------
    env : Environment
        Anything satisfying the protocol.
    policy : Policy
        Reset once here, then called per decision.
    action_repeat : int, default=1
        Environment steps per decision.  The papers use 2 for some
        Control Suite tasks and 4 for others, and it is not a free
        parameter — it sets what one step of the learned dynamics
        *means*, so the same number has to be used when collecting and
        when reporting a return.
    max_steps : int or None, optional
        Cut the episode off after this many recorded steps, reported as
        truncation rather than termination.  ``None`` runs until the
        environment says stop.

    Returns
    -------
    episode : Episode
        ``(T, ...)`` tensors, with ``actions[t]`` the action taken *into*
        step ``t`` — so the first entry is a zero vector, because nothing
        was taken into the first observation.
    total_reward : float
        Undiscounted sum over the episode.

    Notes
    -----
    A repeated action is recorded once per environment step, not once per
    decision, so the stored sequence is at the environment's own rate and
    a model trained on it predicts single steps.
