"""
lucid.utils.rollout: environment contract, episode replay, and the loop
that connects a policy to an environment.

Lucid ships no environments — every compute path here is closed to
outside packages. What it ships is the shape one has to have, storage
that hands a recurrent model contiguous sequences rather than loose
transitions, and the two collection hyperparameters the world-model
papers state: action repeat and exploration noise.
