"""Compile a package once, and open that compiled model every time after.

Core ML runs a compiled model (``.mlmodelc``), and the first time one is
loaded it is specialised into a bundle under the user's caches —
``~/Library/Caches/<app>/com.apple.e5rt.e5bundlecache`` — which for a GPU
segment holds a full copy of the weights: 1.1 GB for YOLO v1.  That bundle
is keyed by the compiled model's path *and* its file identity.  Measured on
macOS 27: opening the same ``.mlmodelc`` again, from the same process or
another, adds nothing; a copy of it adds a new bundle, even one put back at
the very same path.

Compiling on every load therefore wrote a bundle on every load that nothing
would read again.  A development machine's cache reached 121 GB, and the
test suite pushed the disk past macOS's near-low mark, where the purge that
followed aborted a process from inside Core ML (CHA-22, see
``lucid/test/unit/coreml/conftest.py``).

So the compiled model is kept — one per package *content* — and every load
of that content opens the same directory.

Key
    SHA-256 over every file in the package (relative path, size, bytes),
    after the Core ML build and the OS build — a system update compiles
    afresh instead of reusing an older compiler's output.  Content, not
    path: the same package opened from anywhere, or copied elsewhere, is one
    entry, and a package rewritten in place with new weights is a new one.
    So is every *export*, even of an unchanged model: the package's
    ``Manifest.json`` carries identifiers drawn fresh for each one.
Location
    ``LUCID_COREML_CACHE_DIR`` when set; else ``$LUCID_HOME/coreml``, beside
    the weights cache that variable already moves; else
    ``~/.cache/lucid/coreml``.  Entries live in a ``v<format>`` directory
    under it, and only names this module writes there — a 64-digit hex key
    with ``.mlmodelc``, ``.json`` or ``.lock``, or a dot-prefixed scratch
    name with a 32-digit hex suffix — are ever read, swept or removed.  The
    variable can name a directory that holds anything else without that
    being at risk.
Bound
    ``LUCID_COREML_CACHE_LIMIT`` bytes (``K``/``M``/``G``/``T`` suffixes
    accepted), 4 GiB by default — three models the size of YOLO v1.
    Inserting past it removes the least recently used entries, except the
    one just made and any entry a live handle holds, in this process or
    another, so a single model larger than the limit is still compiled once
    and reused while it is open.  ``0`` turns the cache off: each handle
    compiles privately and removes its copy when it closes — which, as
    before, leaves Core ML one bundle per load.
    :func:`lucid.coreml.empty_cache` removes every entry no handle holds.
Concurrency
    A compile is moved into a staging directory inside the cache and
    renamed onto its entry.  ``rename`` is atomic and refuses a non-empty
    target, so of two processes that compile the same package at once one
    wins and the other discards its copy and opens the winner's; two
    threads of one process do not both compile.  Every handle holds a
    shared ``flock`` on its entry's lock file for as long as its model
    lives — the engine keeps a duplicate of the descriptor and closes it
    with the model, so a prediction still running when the handle is closed
    keeps it too.  Eviction asks for an exclusive lock without waiting and
    passes over what it cannot have.  The kernel drops a dead process's
    locks, so a crash leaves nothing held.  A volume that cannot lock files
    — some network shares — cannot keep a cache safely, and is treated like
    one that cannot be written.
Disk
    Core ML does not fail cleanly when the disk fills: it ends the process,
    ``LLVM ERROR: IO failure on output stream: No space left on device``.
    Before compiling or loading, each volume the step writes to is checked
    for what it will write — the compiled model where Core ML compiles it
    and where it is kept, a bundle the size of the package where Core ML
    keeps those — and a shortfall raises :class:`OSError` (``ENOSPC``).

A path that is already a ``.mlmodelc`` is opened where it is: there is
nothing to compile, and opening it in place is what lets its bundle be
reused.

Not bounded here: the bundle Core ML made from an entry that is later
evicted stays in Core ML's cache until macOS purges it.  Its directory names
cannot be traced back to the entry, and Core ML's cache is not Lucid's to
prune.  Reopening a package — the case that grew without bound — writes
none.
