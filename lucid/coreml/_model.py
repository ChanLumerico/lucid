* :meth:`compute_plan` asks Core ML which device each operation landed

    Holds the ``.mlpackage`` on disk plus the compiled model Core ML

    once per handle: the compiled model is kept in Lucid's cache and every
    later handle on the same content — in this process or another — opens
    it, which also lets Core ML reuse the bundle it specialised the model
    into rather than writing another (see :func:`lucid.coreml.empty_cache`).

    Attributes
    ----------
    path : str
        The ``.mlpackage`` this handle opened.
    input_names, output_names : list of str
        Features the package declares, in the order the program names
        them. ``predict`` accepts a tuple in this order or a mapping.
    noise_inputs : list of tuple
        ``(name, shape)`` for each input that stands in for a random
        draw, when the export lifted one — see
        :class:`~lucid.coreml.Draws`. Empty otherwise. A caller who
        passes nothing for these gets a fresh sample.
    deployment_target : DeploymentTarget
        Oldest system the package runs on. Three features raise it:
        carrying state, palettizing weights, several entry points.
    compute_units : ComputeUnits
        What the handle actually opened with, which is not always what
        was asked for — a palettized package is opened ``CPU_AND_NE``
        whatever the request, because Core ML's GPU path unpacks small
        palettes incorrectly.
    precision : str
        ``"FLOAT32"`` or ``"FLOAT16"``, as the package was written — the
        body's precision. ``"UNKNOWN"`` for a package that does not
        record it: one Lucid did not write, or wrote before it did.
    io_precision : str
        Element type of the float inputs and outputs, in the same
        spelling. ``"FLOAT16"`` makes :meth:`predict` convert float32
        inputs on the way in and return float16 tensors.
    palettized : bool
        Whether the program reads a palette.
    image_input : ImageInput or None
        Present when an input is declared as a picture.
    classifier : Classifier or None
        Present when the package answers with a label; read it through
        :meth:`classify` rather than :meth:`predict`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import shutil, tempfile
    >>> import lucid, lucid.nn as nn, lucid.coreml as cml
    >>> model = nn.Sequential(
    ...     nn.Conv2d(3, 16, 3, padding=1), nn.ReLU(),
    ...     nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1), nn.Flatten(), nn.Linear(16, 10),
    ... ).eval()

        Shapes agreeing is not evidence: a package missing a layer has

        compares values — every output, not just the first, since a
        detector that exported its class scores and dropped its boxes
        would otherwise pass.

        The default is an **absolute** difference, which is only
        interpretable against outputs of a known size. A model whose
        outputs differ in magnitude makes that trap easy to fall into:
        RealNVP returns a latent of order 1 beside a log-probability of
        order 1e4, so the absolute worst is set by the second, and
        dividing it by the first reads as a 4% error when every output
        agrees to 1e-6.

        ``relative=True`` scales each output's difference by that
        output's own magnitude — but only down to one, which is the
        other half of the same trap: VQ-VAE's latent has values around
        2e-3, and dividing float32 noise by that reads as 3e-4 when the
        difference is 5e-7. Dividing by ``max(scale, 1)`` is relative
        where relative means something and absolute where it does not,
        which is the same bargain a tolerance pair makes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        model : nn.Module
            The eager model this package was exported from.
        x : Tensor or tuple of Tensor or dict of str to Tensor
            Input to run through both. Host tensors.
        relative : bool, optional, default=False
            Scale each output's difference by that output's own largest
            magnitude, floored at one, before taking the worst.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            The worst ``max|coreml - eager|`` across the outputs, or the
            worst of those divided by each output's own scale when
            ``relative``. Expect ~1e-7 for a float32 export and ~1e-3
            relative for float16.

        Notes
        -----
        For an image export the pixel buffer is eight bits per channel,
        so anything but whole numbers in ``[0, 255]`` is rounded on the
        way in and the two sides see different pixels. That is refused
        rather than reported: for ``randn`` values the rounding is most
        of the signal and the answer would be around 3e-1, which reads
        as a broken export. Feed pixels and the comparison is the usual
        one.

        The first calls are not the model: Core ML defers work to them —
        specialising for the units it was given, laying out weights the
        accelerator wants — and a timing that includes them reports the
        setup. Hence a warmup that is thrown away, and a median over
        repeats rather than a mean, since a scheduling hiccup on a shared
        machine moves a mean and not a median.

        Measured on an M1 Pro with a ResNet-18 at 224 square: 18.6 ms
        eager, 4.5 ms as a float32 package on the CPU, 2.7 ms at float16
        on the CPU, and 1.5 ms with the Neural Engine allowed — so the
        accelerator is worth about 12x against eager and 3x against the
        same package on the CPU. Those are this machine's numbers and
        will not be yours, which is why this exists rather than a
        documented figure.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : Tensor or tuple of Tensor or dict of str to Tensor
