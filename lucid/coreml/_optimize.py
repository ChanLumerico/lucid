"""Training against the compression the export will apply.

Fitting a palette to a finished model is the cheapest thing that could
work, and measured on a trained ResNet-50 it is not enough: four-bit
palettization changes every one of five top-1 predictions. Two ways of
recovering that were tried at export time and both failed — leaving the
stem and the classifier uncompressed did nothing, and a table per
channel was *worse* at six bits and cost 1.5 MB. The loss is spread
through the network rather than concentrated at its ends, which is the
signature of a problem no export setting can fix.

What is left is to make the network tolerate it, which means showing it
the compression while it is still learning. The weight the forward pass
uses is the compressed one; the weight the optimizer updates is the full
precision one behind it. Over a fine-tune the parameters move onto the
palette instead of being rounded onto it afterwards.

The gradient reaches the real parameter through
``w + (compress(w) - w).detach()``: forward it is ``compress(w)``, and
its derivative is one, so the update lands on ``w``. That estimator is
what makes this trainable at all — the compression itself has a zero
derivative almost everywhere and would stop every gradient.

The fitters are the export's own. Training against a palette fitted any
other way would optimise the model for a constraint the package does not
have, which is worse than not training at all: it would look like it
worked.

    optimizer sees is the loss the package will have.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : nn.Module
        Model to fine-tune. It is used in place rather than copied — its
        parameters are what training updates — so keep a checkpoint if
        the uncompressed weights are still wanted.
    weights : WeightPrecision or Palettize or Sparsify
        The same value the export will be given. Anything else trains
        the model for a constraint the package will not have.

    Attributes
    ----------
    covered : list of str
        Qualified names of the weights being compressed. Rank-one
        parameters and anything under the export's size threshold are
        absent, because the export leaves those in floating point too.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> aware = cml.CompressionAware(model, weights=cml.Palettize(bits=4))
    >>> for x, y in loader:
    ...     loss = criterion(aware(x), y)
    ...     loss.backward()
    ...     optimizer.step()
    ...     optimizer.zero_grad()
    >>> aware.refit()               # follow the weights as they move
    >>> settled = aware.settle()
    >>> cml.export(settled, x, path, weights=cml.Palettize(bits=4))

    Notes
    -----
    ``refit`` is the caller's to schedule. The codebook is fitted once at
    construction and the assignment onto it is recomputed every forward,
    so a model drifts away from its palette over a long fine-tune;
    refitting every few hundred steps follows it back. Refitting every
    step is not better — it moves the target the model is chasing.
